It can generate multiple possible scenarios based on variable factors such as volatility and market trends. \nBitcoin Monte Carlo projections by Mark Quant. Source: X.com\nBased on the initial price of $82,655, the study estimated a mean final price of $258,445 by the end of September 2025. However, on a broader scale, the price was expected to fluctuate between $51,430, i.e., a 5th percentile return and $713,000 at the 95th percentile.  \nRelated: Bitcoin slides another 3% \u2014 Is BTC price headed for $69K next?\nHowever, it is important to note that a Monte Carlo model relies strongly on the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model, which assumes that the asset value follows a random path with a constant parameter drift. \nIn this analysis, Bitcoin's inherent volatility is built into the model, capturing long-term historical performance and patterns while adapting to future shifts. Essentially, the Monte Carlo analysis remains as fitting as \u201crolling the dice.\"\nLast week, Quant also highlighted a correlation between the total crypto market cap and the global liquidity index, indicating that the TOTAL market cap value may reach new highs above $4 trillion in Q2 2025. \nBitcoin price dropped 6.38% over the weekend, creating a fresh CME futures gap in the charts.

Based on past behavior, Bitcoin tends to \u201cfill\u201d or return into these gaps on the higher time frame charts, with the previous seven gaps filled out in the past four months. \nMark Cullen, a technical analyst, also highlighted the CME gap, which took form over the weekend, and speculated the possibility of a short squeeze before the US markets open on March 10.
