She said:\n\u201c[The] ECB [European Central Bank] historically and currently is very critical of BTC as a reserve asset, so it effectively closes the doors to all EU member states,\u201d Plotnikova added.\nMeanwhile, European lawmakers are preparing to launch the digital euro, a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\nRelated: US Bitcoin reserve marks \u2018real step\u2019 toward global financial integration\nEuropean lawmakers\u2019 silence on Trump\u2019s Bitcoin reserve order is likely due to its focus on the digital euro, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of venture capital firm DFG.\n\u201cThis stems from the ECB\u2019s firm stance against holding Bitcoin in its reserves, as reiterated by ECB President Christine Lagarde,\u201d Wo told Cointelegraph, adding:\nRelated: Bitcoin reserve backlash signals unrealistic industry expectations\nDespite skepticism, ECB President Christine Lagarde is pushing ahead with the digital euro\u2019s rollout, expected in October 2025. Lagarde has emphasized that the CBDC will coexist with cash and offer privacy protections to address concerns about government overreach.\n\u201cThe European Union is looking to launch the digital euro, our central bank digital currency, by October this year,\u201d Lagarde said during a press conference, adding:\nSource: Cointelegraph\nThe United States and the European Union are taking opposite approaches to digital assets. While the EU is working to integrate a centralized digital currency, Trump has taken a firm stance against CBDCs.\nWhile CBDCs have been praised for their potential to increase financial inclusion, critics have raised concerns about their surveillance capabilities and the potential for government overreach.\nIn July 2023, Brazil\u2019s central bank published the source code for its CBDC pilot, and it took just four days for people to notice the surveillance and control mechanisms embedded within its code, allowing the central bank to freeze or reduce user funds within CBDC wallets.\nMagazine: SCB tips $500K BTC, SEC delays Ether ETF options, and more: Hodler\u2019s Digest, Feb. 23 \u2013 Mar. 1\n","date":1741616515255,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-03-10T14:21:55.255144"}
