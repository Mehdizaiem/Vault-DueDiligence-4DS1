The Philly Fed Business Outlook survey is showing expectations today comparable to 2000, 2008 and 2022,\u201d he told X followers.\nAn accompanying chart showed the Philadelphia Fed\u2019s Business Outlook Survey (BOS) back under 15 for the first time since the start of 2024. Late 2022 was the pit of the most recent crypto bear market when BTC\/USD reversed at $15,600.\nPhiladelphia Fed Business Outlook Survey vs. S&P 500.

The exact date is less important,\u201d analyst Colin Talks Crypto predicted in an X thread this week.\nA comparative chart hinted at a potential BTC price rebound by the start of May.\nUS M2 money supply vs BTC\/USD chart.
