In August 2024, the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), alleging that Coinbase\u2019s corporate contributions to Fairshake and the Congressional Leadership Fund constituted a violation of federal election law due to their status as a federal contractor.\nRelated: Bitcoin reserve backlash signals unrealistic industry expectations\nCoinbase has committed an additional $25 million to Fairshake for the 2026 midterm election cycle.\nCoinbase commits $25 million to Fairshake.

Still, this is part of the organic growth of the emerging crypto industry, Lian said, adding:\nThe debate over crypto\u2019s role in politics follows the high-profile collapse of the Libra (LIBRA) token, a memecoin endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei. The project\u2019s insiders allegedly siphoned over $107 million worth of liquidity in a rug pull, triggering a 94% price collapse within hours and wiping out $4 billion.\nOver 100 governmental fraud complaints have been opened in Argentina since the Libra memecoin\u2019s scandal, illustrating the risks of a country\u2019s executive branch promoting \u201cany kind of unregulated security,\u201d the CPA\u2019s report states.\nMagazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom\n","date":1741616533493,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-03-10T14:22:13.493314"}
