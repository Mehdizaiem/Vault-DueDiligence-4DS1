Meanwhile, Ether (ETH) shed over 12% in the same time frame and was trading at $1,575, according to CoinGecko. The total crypto market cap dropped over 8% to $2.5 trillion.\u00a0\nPrices have clawed back some losses since. Bitcoin has recovered 1.4% to $78,500. Meanwhile, Ether regained $1,594.\nSource: Autism Capital\nAt the same time, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, returned a score of 23 in its latest April 7 update, which is considered extreme fear.\nIn a statement, Charlie Sherry, head of finance at Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said the drop is unsurprising because global markets are generally more illiquid on Sundays. \n\u201cAs a result, a few large sell-offs can have a disproportionate impact, pushing prices down quickly,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nSome traders, however, predict a Bitcoin breakout could be around the corner. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has also speculated that while the tariffs are rattling markets, they could result in a Bitcoin rally.\u00a0\nThe US Stock Futures market has also opened down. \nFutures tied to the S&P 500 dropped nearly 4%, according to Google Finance. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank by over 8%.\u00a0\nTrading resource the Kobeissi Letter said in an April 6 post to X that the drop in US stock market futures puts S&P 500 futures in \u201dbear market territory,\u201d adding that the US stock market has now erased an average of $400 billion per trading day for the last 32 days.\u00a0\nSource: Kobeissi Letter\nTom Dunleavy, a managing partner at venture capital firm MV Global,\u00a0said\u00a0it could be the \u201cworst three-day move for US stocks of all time\u201d if \u201ctonight\u2019s futures hold.\u201d\u00a0\nCrypto-friendly billionaire investor Bill Ackman speculates that US President Donald Trump could postpone the tariffs to allow countries to make counteroffers or deals.\nIn an April 6 statement on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump doubled down on the tariffs, saying the US has massive financial deficits with China, the European Union and many others, which the levies will solve.\nRelated: \u2018National emergency\u2019 as Trump\u2019s tariffs dent crypto prices\n\u201cThe only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing tens of billions of dollars into the USA.
