In contrast, the S&P 500 plunged 10.65% this week, and gold\u2014after hitting a record $3,167 on April 3\u2014has slipped 4.8%.\nBTC\/USD vs. gold and S&P 500 daily performance chart.

Bitcoin's breakout followed shortly after, rallying over 170% in early 2019 and then surging another 344% by late 2020.\nBTC\/USD vs. XAU\/USD three-day price chart.

The breakdown followed a second major support test at the 50-2W exponential moving average. \nBTC\/XAU ratio two-week chart. Source: TradingView\nBTC\/XAU is now repeating this fractal and once again testing the red 50-EMA as support.\nIn the previous cycle, Bitcoin consolidated around the same EMA level before breaking decisively lower, eventually finding support at the 200-2W EMA (the blue wave). If history repeats, BTC\/XAU could be on track for a deeper correction, especially if macro conditions worsen.\nInterestingly, these breakdown cycles have coincided with a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value in dollar terms, as shown below.\nBTC\/USD 2W price chart. Source: TradingView\nShould the fractal repeat, Bitcoin\u2019s initial downside target could be its 50-2W EMA around the $65,000 level, with additional selloffs suggesting declines below $20,000, aligning with the 200-2W EMA. \nA bounce from BTC\/XAU\u2019s 50-2W EMA, on the other hand, may invalidate the bearish fractal.\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Bitcoin\u2019s price outlook appears skewed to the downside. \nInvestors are concerned that President Donald Trump's global tariff war could spiral into a full-blown trade war and trigger a\u00a0US recession. Risk assets like Bitcoin tend to underperform during economic contractions.\nRelated: Bitcoin \u2018decouples,\u2019 stocks lose $3.5T amid Trump tariff war and Fed warning of \u2018higher inflation\u2019\nFurther dampening sentiment, on April 4, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pushed back against expectations for near-term interest rate cuts.\nPowell warned that inflation progress remains uneven, signaling a prolonged high-rate environment that may add more pressure to Bitcoin\u2019s upside momentum.\nNonetheless, most bond traders see three consecutive rate cuts until the Fed\u2019s September meeting, according to CME data.  \nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
