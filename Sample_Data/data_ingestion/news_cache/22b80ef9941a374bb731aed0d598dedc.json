A further drop to $67,000, the average entry-level of Strategy\u2019s Michael Saylor, also remains a possibility.\nSource: @ChrisTradesXYZ\nBitcoin appeared to have found short-term support at around $74,000, which corresponds to a notable cost-basis cluster where over 50,000 BTC are held. \nGlassnode\u2019s UTXO realized price distribution (URPD) heatmap shows this is the first major cost-basis cluster below $80,000. These holders raised their average buy price until March 10, then stopped moving coins\u2014showing confidence, not panic.\nBitcoin URPD heatmap.

The largest cluster sits at $71,600, with 41,000 BTC concentrated there, making it the likely next support if $74,000 breaks.\nRelated: Black Monday 2.0? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\nMeanwhile, Glassnode\u2019s Short-Term Holder (STH) realized price bands place the current average STH cost basis at $89,000, with the -1 standard deviation band at $69,000. \nBitcoin STH onchain cost basis bands.

In most cases, such corrections have led the price toward the 200-week EMA, as shown in red circular areas below.\nBTC\/USD weekly price chart.
