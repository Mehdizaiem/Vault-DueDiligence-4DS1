However, on March 3, El Salvador purchased 5 BTC in a single day.\nEl Salvador struck a deal with the IMF in December 2024 for a $1.4 billion loan from the organization. As part of that deal, the government of El Salvador agreed to rescind the status of BTC as legal tender in the country and scale back public sector involvement with Bitcoin.\nEl Salvador Bitcoin holdings.
