The failure of the bears to capitalize on the opportunity shows a lack of selling at lower levels.\nRisky assets were rattled after US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on several countries on April 2. The fall in the US markets deepened on April 4 after China announced a retaliatory tariff of 34% on all imported US goods starting April 10.\nWhile several market participants are concerned about the near-term impact of tariffs, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said he loves tariffs since he expects them to be positive for Bitcoin and gold in the medium term.\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\nOn the more cautious side was market commentator Byzantine General, who said in a post on X that the cryptocurrency market\u2019s upside would be limited due to possible tariff responses.\u00a0\nCapriole Investments founder Charles Edwards said in his analysis that Bitcoin would turn bullish on a break and close above $91,000. If that does not happen, he anticipates Bitcoin to fall to the $71,000 zone.\nCould Bitcoin outperform by staying above $80,000? Will the altcoins crumble? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.\nBitcoin rose above the resistance line on April 2, but the long wick on the candlestick shows solid selling at higher levels. The price turned down sharply and broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($84,483).\nBTC\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nThe bears will have to sink the price below the $80,000 support to strengthen their position. If they do that, the BTC\/USDT pair could retest the March 11 low of $76,606. Buyers are expected to defend this level with all their might because a break and close below $76,606 could sink the pair to $73,777 and eventually to $67,000.\nThe crucial resistance to watch out for on the upside is $88,500. A break and close above this level will signal that the corrective phase may be over. The pair could then start its journey toward $95,000.\nEther (ETH) has been trading between the $1,754 support and the 20-day EMA ($1,928) for the past few days.\nETH\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nThat increases the likelihood of a break and close below $1,754. If sellers can pull it off, the ETH\/USDT pair could start the next leg of the downtrend to $1,550.\nA minor positive in favor of the bulls is that the relative strength index (RSI) has formed a positive divergence. That suggests the bearish momentum may be weakening. If the price rebounds off $1,754, the pair could face selling at the 20-day EMA. However, if buyers overcome the obstacle, the pair could rally to $2,111. A short-term trend reversal will be signaled on a close above $2,111.\nXRP (XRP) bears successfully defended the 20-day EMA ($2.23) on April 2 and pulled the price to the critical support at $2.\nXRP\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nThe downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 44 increase the risk of a break below $2. If that happens, the XRP\/USDT pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. The pair has support at $1.77, but if the level gets taken out, the decline could extend to $1.27.\nBuyers have an uphill task ahead of them if they want to prevent the breakdown. They will have to swiftly push the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($2.37) to clear the path for a relief rally to the resistance line.\nBNB (BNB) bulls failed to push the price back above the moving averages in the past few days, indicating selling at higher levels.\nBNB\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nThe moving averages have started to turn down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling a minor advantage for the bears. There is support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $575 and next at the 61.8% retracement level of $559.\nOn the upside, the bulls will have to push and maintain the price above the 50-day SMA ($614) to signal a comeback. The BNB\/USDT pair may rise to $644, which is a critical overhead resistance to watch out for. If buyers overcome the barrier at $644, the pair may travel to $686.\nSolana (SOL) rose above the 20-day EMA ($128) on April 2, but the bears sold at higher levels and pulled the price below the $120 support.\nSOL\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nThe downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory heighten the risk of a break below $110. If that happens, the selling could intensify, and the SOL\/USDT pair may plummet to $100 and subsequently to $80.\nThe bulls are unlikely to give up easily and will try to keep the pair inside the $110 to $260 range. Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above $147 to suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair may then ascend to $180.\nDogecoin (DOGE) bears thwarted attempts by the bulls to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.17) on April 2.\nDOGE\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nA positive sign in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to slide below the $0.16 support. A break above the 20-day EMA could push the price to the 50-day SMA ($0.19). Buyers will have to overcome the 50-day SMA to start a rally to $0.24 and later to $0.29.\nAlternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages and breaks below $0.16, it will clear the path for a drop to $0.14. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $0.14 support because a break below it may sink the DOGE\/USDT pair to $0.10.\nCardano (ADA) turned down sharply from the 20-day EMA ($0.69) on April 2 and closed below the uptrend line.\nADA\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nThe bulls are trying to push the price back above the uptrend line but are likely to face solid selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the ADA\/USDT pair could descend to $0.58 and then to $0.50.\nThis negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up sharply and breaks above the 50-day SMA ($0.74). That opens the doors for a rally to $0.84, which may attract sellers.\u00a0\nRelated: Altcoins are set for one last big rally, but just a few will benefit \u2014 Analyst\nToncoin\u2019s (TON) failure to maintain above the $4.14 resistance on April 1 may have tempted short-term traders to book profits.\nTON\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nThe TON\/USDT pair broke below the 20-day EMA ($3.65) on April 3, indicating that the bullish momentum is weakening. There is support at $3.32, but if the level cracks, the pair may drop to $2.81.\nInstead, if the price rebounds off $3.32, the pair could attempt to form a range in the near term. The pair could swing between $3.32 and $4.14 for some time. A break and close above $4.14 will signal that the downtrend may be over. The pair could then jump to $5.\nUNUS SED LEO (LEO) bears pulled the price below the uptrend line on March 2 but could not sustain the lower levels. That suggests buying at lower levels.\nLEO\/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nThe 20-day EMA ($9.57) is turning down gradually, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling a slight advantage to the bears. If the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the LEO\/USD pair below the $8.84 support. If they succeed, the pair may tumble to $8.\nContrarily, a break above the moving averages opens the doors for a rise to the overhead resistance of $9.90. If buyers pierce the $9.90 resistance, the pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern. The pair may then climb toward the target objective of $12.04.\nChainlink (LINK) once again turned down from the 20-day EMA ($13.98) on March 2, indicating that the bears continue selling on rallies.\nLINK\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nThe LINK\/USDT pair has strong support in the zone between $12 and the support line of the descending channel pattern. A rebound off the support zone will have to rise above the moving averages to signal a stronger recovery toward $17.50.\nSellers are likely to have other plans. They will attempt to pull the price below the support line. If they can pull it off, the pair could extend the downtrend toward the crucial support at $10 and, after that, to $8.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
