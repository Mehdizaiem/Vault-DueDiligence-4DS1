It is one of the fastest-growing crypto sectors, reaching a total value locked (TVL) of over $8.6 billion.\nThe growing value of BTCFi, \u201calong with potential interest rate cuts, may reinforce positive sentiment for Bitcoin in the medium and long term,\u201d Binance Research wrote in a report shared with Cointelegraph.\nBitcoin DeFi, total value locked, 2025 chart.
