Source: Cointelegraph\nMessari CEO Eric Turner agreed, saying, \u201cWe never had a bull market,\u201d but rather \u201ctwo sides of the market.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe had Bitcoin where all the flows went into [exchange-traded funds]\u201d and \u201cthen you have pockets of things,\u201d such as the memecoin frenzy and other short-term trends, he said.\n\u201cI actually think the real question is, when does the bull market come? If you ask me, that\u2019s going to be Q3, Q4 of this year,\u201d said Turner.\nBeyond short-term price action, it helps to look at the big picture, especially in the United States, said John Patrick Mullin, the co-founder and CEO of Mantra. Mullin said he\u2019s \u201cexcited\u201d about all of the favorable policy tailwinds coming from the United States, including the Executive Branch.\nRelated: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from over\nUS President Donald Trump is overseeing an overhaul of crypto regulations in Washington, with lawmakers moving closer to passing landmark stablecoin and market structure bills.\u00a0\nTrump has also appointed pro-crypto leaders to various positions, chief among them being Paul Atkins, who recently moved one step closer to securing the nomination as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nHowever, these positive developments have failed to kickstart the bull market or bring meaningful capital flows into the industry, largely because Trump\u2019s other agenda items \u2014 namely, tackling perceived trade imbalances \u2014 have triggered growth fears.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on April 2 were perceived by many investors as an egregious attempt to rewrite the terms of global trade, as they went beyond the 10% universal tariff proposed initially.\u00a0\nSource: Andrea Junker\nThe tariff announcement triggered the largest exodus from US stocks since the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\nHowever, if past crises like COVID-19 are anything to go by, the US Federal Reserve will likely step in at some point to backstop the market should things get progressively worse.\n\u201c[...] If you go back in time with another crisis and at some point the Fed steps in to lower the rates and to print money to stimulate the internal economy,\u201d van de Poppe said during the panel discussion.\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s going to happen. The question is when,\u201d said van de Poppe.\nMagazine: Bitcoin heading to $70K soon?
