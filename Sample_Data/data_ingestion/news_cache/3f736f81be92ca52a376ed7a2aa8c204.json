I think that trigger may be as simple as the Fed not cutting rates at all this year,\u201d Peterson said in a March 8 X post. Peterson\u2019s comment comes just a day after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell reiterated that he's in no hurry to adjust interest rates.\n\"We do not need to be in a hurry and are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity,\u201d Powell said in a speech in New York on March 7.\nSource: Timothy Peterson\nPeterson, who is the author of the paper \u201cMetcalfe\u2019s Law as a Model for Bitcoin\u2019s Value,\u201d estimated how low the Nasdaq could fall to predict Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) potential bottom in \u201cthe next bear market.\u201d\nUsing Peterson\u2019s Nasdaq lowest price forward model, he estimated that once the bear market begins, the Nasdaq would decline 17% over roughly seven months before finding a bottom.\nApplying a \u201c1.9\u201d times multiplier to that amount for Bitcoin\u2019s decline, he estimated a 33% decline in Bitcoin, bringing it down to $57,000 from its current price at publication, $86,199, according to CoinMarketCap data.\nSource: Timothy Peterson\nHowever, he said Bitcoin likely won\u2019t drop that far, expecting a floor price closer to the low $70,000 range based on historical trends from 2022.\n\u201cTraders and opportunists hover over Bitcoin like vultures,\u201d he said, explaining that once the market expects Bitcoin to hit $57,000, \u201cit won\u2019t get there because there are always some investors who step in because the price is \u2018low enough.\u201d\n\u201cI remember in 2022 when everyone said the bottom would be $12k.\u00a0 It only went to $16k, 25% higher than expected,\u201d he said before pointing out that the 25% increase from $57,000 is $71,000.\u00a0\nThe last time Bitcoin traded near the $71,000 price level was on Nov. 6, after Donald Trump won the US election, before rallying for a month and reaching $100,000 by Dec. 5.\nRelated: Bitcoin investors share mixed reactions to White House Crypto Summit\nIn January 2025, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes echoed a similar price prediction.\n\u201cI am calling for a $70k to $75k correction in BTC a mini financial crisis, and a resumption of money printing that will send us to $250k by the end of the year,\u201d Hayes said in a Jan. 27 X post.\nIn December 2024, crypto mining firm Blockware Solutions said Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cbear case\u201d for 2025 would be $150,000, assuming the Federal Reserve reverses course on interest rate cuts.\nMagazine: Meet lawyer Max Burwick \u2014 \u2018The ambulance chaser of crypto\u2019\n","date":1741531239412,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-03-09T14:40:39.412784"}
