Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nOne of the clearest signs that there is more choppy price action ahead for Bitcoin is the presence of muted funding rates in the BTC futures markets.\nKey points:\nFunding rates are periodic payments made between long and short traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep prices aligned with the spot market.\nWhen this metric turns negative, it means short sellers are paying long holders, indicating that bearish sentiment dominates.\nBTC funding rates have been oscillating around 0% since late February, indicating indecisiveness dominates the market.\nBTC perpetual futures funding rates across all exchanges. Source: Glassnode\nWhen funding rates are zero, the cost of holding positions is minimal, reducing pressure on traders to exit longs or shorts and leading to price consolidation.\nCommenting on the funding rate, crypto analyst Axel Adler Junior said that Bitcoin\u2019s average funding rate on major exchanges \u201chas dropped into negative territory,\u201d currently sitting just above zero.\nAccording to the analyst, positive signals from the US Federal Reserve and the Trump administration could renew fresh inflows into the market, \u201cpotentially triggering the start of a new rally.\u201d\nSeveral onchain metrics suggest Bitcoin\u2019s April 2 rally to $87,500 was just a \u201crelief rally within a broader downtrend rather than the beginning of a sustained reversal,\u201d according to market intelligence firm Glassnode.\nIn its latest market report, Glassnode found that the 90-day simple moving average of Bitcoin\u2019s Realized Profit\/Loss Ratio had declined significantly since January, despite repeated rallies in the $76,000\u2013$80,000 range.\nThese brief profit-driven surges have failed to end the ongoing consolidation, suggesting that the \u201cmacro picture remains one of generally weaker liquidity and deteriorating investor profitability,\u201d it said.\nBitcoin: Realized profit and loss ratio.
