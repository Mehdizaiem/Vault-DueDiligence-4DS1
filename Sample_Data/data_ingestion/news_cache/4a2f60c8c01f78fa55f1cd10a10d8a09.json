However, he acknowledged that the exact number of BTC held by the government is unknown because there\u2019s never been a comprehensive audit.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do a full government-wide audit to find out what digital assets we actually have so they can be safeguarded and moved into a strategy that maximizes their long-term value,\u201d he said.\nDavid Sacks said the US government will build a strategic digital asset stockpile. Source: Bloomberg Technology\u00a0\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s March 6 executive order calling for a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile directed federal agencies to conduct a full audit of their cryptocurrency holdings.\u00a0\nRegarding the digital asset stockpile, \u201cThe difference there is that the secretary of the treasury [Scott Bessent] will exercise responsible stewardship over those assets, and he has the discretion to rebalance the portfolio or to sell items in that portfolio, but that\u2019s not true for Bitcoin,\u201d said Sacks.\nWith the Bitcoin reserve, the \u201cgoal is long-term preservation,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the stockpile, the goal is [...] portfolio management, in essence.\u201d\nSacks said the digital asset portfolio strategy could include the sale or even staking of digital assets based on the treasury secretary\u2019s discretion. \nSacks didn\u2019t single out any particular altcoin and cautioned against reading too much into President Trump\u2019s March 2 announcement declaring Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) as being part of the stockpile.\n\u201cThe president just mentioned the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap, so I think people are just reading into this a little bit too much,\u201d said Sacks. Ultimately, a decision on which assets to include will depend on the government-wide audit.\nSource: David Sacks\nRelated: David Sacks laments US government\u2019s sale of Bitcoin\nTrump\u2019s executive order and Sacks\u2019 commentary failed to provide a short-term boost to Bitcoin and crypto prices, but that could be about to change as markets fully dissect the significance of the latest US policy developments.\u00a0\nJoe Kelly, CEO of Bitcoin financial services company Unchained, told Cointelegraph, \u201cMarkets may still exercise caution until we see the scale and strategy behind this accumulation, but the bigger picture isn\u2019t about short-term price movements.\u201d He added:\nAurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, singled out one sentence from the executive order fact sheet as being \u201cmildly bullish for BTC\u201d in the short term: \u201cThe Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional Bitcoin.\u201d\n\u201cDoes this mean some potential asset swapping, say from euro to Japanese yen to Bitcoin?\u201d asked Barthere.\u00a0\nBeyond the executive order hype, Barthere said Bitcoin\u2019s price action is being influenced by macroeconomic conditions, including the economy and potential changes to Federal Reserve policy.\n\u201cThe recent Bitcoin price pullback was unavoidable, as I forecasted at the beginning of the year, as the broader financial market needed to digest the impacts of Trump\u2019s tariffs policy,\u201d said CK Zheng, former global head of risk for Credit Suisse and founder of ZX Squared Capital.\u00a0\n\u201cI believe Bitcoin is currently in the process of bottoming out in the near term and will rebound through 2025 as more pro-crypto rules and regulations roll out,\u201d Zheng said.\nZheng believes the strategic Bitcoin reserve may serve as a catalyst for future nation-state adoption.\u00a0\nMagazine: Legal issues surround the FBI\u2019s creation of fake crypto tokens\n","date":1741454990895,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-03-08T17:29:50.895322"}
