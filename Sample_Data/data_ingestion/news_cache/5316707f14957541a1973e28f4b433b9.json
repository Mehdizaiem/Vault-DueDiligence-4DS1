BTC Tools data shows that this metric touched a low of $906.9 billion on April 9 and stood at $976.9 billion at the time of writing.\nVenture capital funding to crypto projects has reportedly decreased by 50%\u201360% from 2021\u201322. In the report, Coinbase\u2019s global head of research, David Duong, highlighted that a new crypto winter may be upon us.\n\u201cSeveral converging signals may be pointing to the start of a new \u2018crypto winter\u2019 as some extreme negative sentiment has set in due to the onset of global tariffs and the potential for further escalations,\u201d he said.\nContinue reading\nManta Network co-founder Kenny Li said he was targeted by a sophisticated phishing attack on Zoom that used live recordings of familiar people in an attempt to lure him to download malware.\u00a0\nThe meeting seemed real with the impersonated person\u2019s camera on, but the lack of sound and a suspicious prompt to download a script raised red flags, Li said in an April 17 X post.\n\u201cI could see their legit faces. Everything looked very real. But I couldn\u2019t hear them. It said my Zoom needs an update. But it asked me to download a script file. I immediately left.\u201d\nLi then asked the impersonator to verify themselves over a Telegram call, however, they didn\u2019t comply and proceeded to erase all messages and block him soon after.\nLi said the North Korean state-backed Lazarus Group was behind the attack.\nThe Manta Network co-founder managed to screenshot his conversation with the attacker before the messages were deleted, during which Li initially suggested moving the call over to Google Meet.\nSpeaking with Cointelegraph, Li said he believed the live shots used in the video call were taken from past recordings of real team members.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem AI-generated. The quality looked like what a typical webcam quality looks like.\u201d\nContinue reading\nThe cryptocurrency market is still recycling old narratives, with few new trends yet to emerge and replace the leading themes in the first quarter of 2025.\nArtificial intelligence tokens and memecoins were the dominant crypto narratives in the first quarter of 2025, accounting for 62.8% of investor interest, according to a quarterly research report by CoinGecko. AI tokens captured 35.7% of global investor interest, overtaking the 27.1% share of memecoins, which remained in second place.\nOut of the top 20 crypto narratives of the quarter, six were memecoin categories while five were AI-related.\n\u201cSeems like we have yet to see another new narrative emerge and we are still following past quarters\u2019 trends,\u201d said Bobby Ong, the co-founder and chief operating officer of CoinGecko, in an April 17 X post. \u201cI guess we are all tired from the same old trends repeating themselves.\u201d\nContinue reading\nThe crypto lending market\u2019s size remains significantly down from its $64 billion high, but decentralized finance (DeFi) borrowing has made a more than 900% recovery from bear market lows.\nCrypto lending enables borrowers to use their crypto holdings as collateral to obtain crypto or fiat loans, while lenders can use their holdings to generate interest.\nThe crypto lending market was down over 43%, from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021 to $36.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a Galaxy Digital research report published on April 14.\n\u201cThe decline can be attributed to the decimation of lenders on the supply side and funds, individuals, and corporate entities on the demand side,\u201d according to Zack Pokorny, research associate at Galaxy Digital.\nThe decline in the crypto lending market started in 2022 when centralized finance (CeFi) lenders Genesis, Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager filed for bankruptcy within two years as crypto valuations fell.\nTheir collective downfall led to an estimated 78% collapse in the size of the lending market, with CeFi lending losing 82% of its open borrows, according to the report.\nContinue reading\nAccording to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, most of the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ended the week in the green.\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium\u2019s (RAY) token rose over 26% as the week\u2019s biggest gainer, followed by the AB blockchain (AB) utility token, up over 19% on the weekly chart.\nThanks for reading our summary of this week\u2019s most impactful DeFi developments.
