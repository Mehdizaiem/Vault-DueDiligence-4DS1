The S&P 500 lost more than $5 trillion, its largest drop on record, surpassing the pandemic-induced crash in March 2020, according to Reuters.\nStill, some analysts see a silver lining to the tariff announcement.\n\u201cIn my opinion, the tariffs are the representation of the uncertainty in the markets,\u201d Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph. \u201cLiberation Day is basically the peak of that period, the climax of uncertainty. Now it\u2019s out in the open. Everybody knows the new playing field.\u201d\nVan de Poppe added that he believes Trump is using tariffs as a strategic move to stimulate domestic growth and reduce yields. \u201cTariffs are literally the only way to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019re reversed within the next six to 12 months.\u201d\nAverage tariff rate on US goods and imports.

She added:\n\u201cFor crypto, BTC continues to act like a risk asset short-term while its analog counterpart gold breaks through one all-time high after another,\u201d a development that may impact crypto investor sentiment in the short term, Acheson said.\nMeanwhile, crypto intelligence firm Nansen estimated a 70% probability that the market could bottom by June, depending on how the tariff negotiations evolve.\nMagazine: Bitcoin ATH sooner than expected?
