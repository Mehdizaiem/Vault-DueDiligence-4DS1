It was one of the first actions of Trump\u2019s second presidential term, which started on Jan. 20.\u00a0\nIn February, Trump signed another order instructing the US government to create a sovereign wealth fund, which could potentially serve as a vehicle for buying BTC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the United Arab Emirates purchase Bitcoin. You\u2019re going to look at some of the sovereign wealth funds around the world who are not as tied up in a democratic republic like we are, be able to just make it so,\u201d Lummis reportedly said.\u00a0\nThere are currently 18 US states that have crypto reserve bills pending Senate votes, while two \u2014 Arizona and Utah \u2014\u00a0 are in the final stages of the approval process.\nState crypto investment bills have been rejected in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota and Pennsylvania.\u00a0\nAlthough some states run by Democrats might resist Trump\u2019s crypto-friendly stance, others are expected to embrace crypto as a bipartisan issue. \n\u201c[T]here are so many states out there that are pro-crypto, and they don\u2019t necessarily follow blue or red policies,\u201d Ashley Gunn, Coinbase\u2019s senior manager for US policy, said during a Feb. 28 ETHDenver panel attended by Cointelegraph. \nEstablishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States would accelerate Bitcoin\u2019s adoption even more than 2024\u2019s exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches, cryptocurrency researcher CoinShares said in January.\n\u201cWe believe that the enactment of the Bitcoin Act in the United States would have a more profound long-term impact on Bitcoin than the launch of ETFs,\u201d CoinShares said.\nLaunched in January 2024, US-based Bitcoin ETFs hold upward of $100 billion worth of BTC.\nMagazine: 3AC-related OX.FUN denies insolvency rumors, Bybit goes to war: Asia Express\n","date":1740785527249,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-02-28T23:32:07.249936"}
