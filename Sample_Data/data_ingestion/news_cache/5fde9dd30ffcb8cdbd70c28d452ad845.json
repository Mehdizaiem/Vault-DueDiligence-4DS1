The correction led to over $1.6 billion in leveraged long (buy) liquidations, adding to market volatility as exchanges forcefully sold contracts. The $21,210 decline marked the largest seven-day drop in Bitcoin\u2019s history.\nDespite the pullback, several Bitcoin analysts see this as a strong buying opportunity. They cite factors such as regulatory developments, sovereign fund exposure, onchain and technical signals, and increasing integration with traditional finance, including bank adoption as collateral and structured product offerings.\nSource: Obviously_Obv\nUser Obviously_Obv, reportedly a Web3 game researcher at Sigil Fund, stated that the current price action resembles a \u201cbear trap,\u201d as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hit its lowest levels since 2022. He also claimed that government entities worldwide are \u201cabout to buy Bitcoin,\u201d not just the U.S.\nSimilarly, Eric Weiss, CEO of Blockchain Investment Group LP, shared a report from Tephra Digital outlining key events that could drive higher adoption rates and positively impact Bitcoin\u2019s price.\nSource: Eric_BIGfund\nAccording to the report, the next steps include in-kind creation and redemption for Bitcoin ETF issuers in the US, improving market efficiency. Another key factor is the legal classification of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, which would allow BTC deposits to be used as collateral, similar to gold. Analysts also highlight increasing exposure from sovereign wealth funds and the approval of solicited sales by banks as potential catalysts for wider Bitcoin adoption.\nUser apsk32, allegedly an engineer and Bitcoin enthusiast, stated that based on historical four-year cycle patterns, BTC is \u201con track for\u201d reaching $230,000 to $290,000 by December 2025.\nSource: apsk32\nAccording to the analyst, traders should \u201csoak up the cheap coins\u201d as the \u201copportunity won\u2019t last forever.\u201d From an onchain analysis perspective, data suggests that long-term holders were not the main contributors to Bitcoin\u2019s drop below $80,000, increasing the likelihood of a swift recovery above $95,000.\nSource: CarlBMenger\nUser CarlBMenger, author of the Carl \u20bf Menger's Newsletter, noted that \u201c74% of the realized Bitcoin losses came from holders who bought in the last month.\u201d He added that inexperienced traders are folding under pressure, while seasoned investors remain unaffected by the price fluctuation.\nBeyond the potential buying pressure from nation-states, Luke Broyles, a collaborator at Blockware Mining, explained on X that a single US-listed company could acquire 84,090 BTC. This would make it the second-largest holder after Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which currently holds 499,096 BTC.\nSource: luke_broyles\nBroyles\u2019 hypothesis assumes the company would use its entire cash and equivalent position to buy Bitcoin at $88,000 and raise an additional $3 billion in debt to increase holdings at $110,000. However, even if GameStop allocated only 20% of its current reserves, that would represent 11,765 BTC at $85,000\u2014enough to secure the fourth-largest position behind MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms.\nRelated: GameStop rises 18% after hours on reports it\u2019s considering investing in Bitcoin\nDifferent analysis models suggest that buying Bitcoin below $85,000 is a golden opportunity, one that may not be available for long. Bitcoin's censorship resistance and digital scarcity features have not been impacted by the worsening macroeconomic environment. In time, its price is expected to rise above $100,000, reflecting the conviction of its current holders and benefiting from deeper integration into the traditional finance system.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
