Here are his responses in full. \nQuestion #1:\u00a0What is your gut feeling\u2014do you think the DHS actually interviewed the real Satoshi?Answer:\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s very possible that the DHS agent was mistaken in what she said at that conference.\u00a0I think DHS agents may have met with bitcoin code maintainers, or with actual Satoshi imposters. But, who knows?\u00a0The DHS agent was a pretty high ranking official and was in a position to know what she was talking about. Either way, I think it will be productive to find out and hopefully resolve this question. Nothing prevents DHS from voluntarily revealing the information without need for protracted litigation.\u201dQuestion #2:\u00a0If the agency did speak with the four creators \u2014 who may be ordinary US citizens \u2014 why do you believe revealing their identities serves the public interest, even if it could put their safety or privacy at risk?Answer:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t understand the question. The identities of the creators of all of the largest blockchain projects, like Charles Hoskinson and Vitalik Buterin etc., are all well known in the crypto community. There are also many major figures like Michael Saylor, Tim Draper and others who have amassed enormous wealth through investment in bitcoin and their identities are well known.There are hundreds of documentaries on YouTube where amateur sleuths have tried to identify Satoshi. I\u2019m not one of them.\u00a0I\u2019m not hiring investigators to try to track down Satoshi, I\u2019m seeking government records under transparency laws in effect in the U.S. If DHS did, in fact, learn Satoshi\u2019s identity,\u00a0then I\u2019m not sure what the rationale is for dozens of government employees to have this information but withhold it from the general public. Our government is required to be transparent and not keep secrets from the citizens, absent a legitimate national security concern or other limited exemption.\u00a0We consider this a fundamental aspect of our freedom in the USA. It is why we have something called the \u201cFreedom of Information Act.\u201d Transparency is good, the government hiding information from the citizenry is generally bad.\nI am open about the fact that I am pro-bitcoin, having been an investor in bitcoin and a bitcoin miner since 2017. I speak to groups of executives and policy makers about bitcoin and I advocate for bitcoin adoption. What I find when I give these talks is very often these audiences (who are new to bitcoin) struggle with the idea that the creator of bitcoin is unknown while the provenance of the other major crypto projects is (relatively) transparent.\nSo, my intention is to either conclusively refute the claim of the DHS agent that they interviewed Satoshi, or achieve some transparency that will open the door to greater bitcoin adoption in the U.S. and around the globe.\u00a0I support President Trump\u2019s initiatives to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Since the bitcoin code is open source and can only be changed through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) procedure, Satoshi (if he or they were identified) would have no ability to unilaterally affect changes to bitcoin.\u00a0As a result, any revelation of Satoshi\u2019s identity is unlikely to adversely impact bitcoin.\u00a0It\u2019s more likely that such transparency would be a net positive for growing bitcoin adoption. Others may have different views on that and I respect their opinions.\u201d\nThe lawsuit follows a wave of recent efforts attempting to uncover Satoshi\u2019s identity.Last October, a controversial HBO documentary claimed that Peter Todd, a Bitcoin cypherpunk, invented Bitcoin. Todd refuted that conclusion, and most industry pundits said HBO\u2019s evidence was weak.\nNick Szabo, Adam Back and Hal Finney have also had their names tied to Satoshi\u2019s identity. Szabo and Back regularly refute claims they\u2019re Satoshi, as did Finney before he died in 2013.\nMeanwhile, members of the Bitcoin community are split on whether unveiling Satoshi\u2019s identity would be a net positive for Bitcoin.\nSome worry that revealing Satoshi's identity could compromise Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized ethos and put Satoshi\u2019s safety at risk, while others want to be reassured that Bitcoin wasn\u2019t created by the US government.\nMagazine: 10 crypto theories that missed as badly as \u2018Peter Todd is Satoshi\u2019\n","date":1744105247974,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-04-08T09:40:47.974556"}
