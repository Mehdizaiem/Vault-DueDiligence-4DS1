Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nCrazzyblock, a Bitcoin trader and verified analyst on CryptoQuant said that Bitcoin\u2019s 60-day RCV reached its lowest level of -1.9 in the chart, signaling an \u2018optimal DCA opportunity\u2019 for the first time since July 2024.\u00a0\nBitcoin 60-day RCV chart. Source: CryptoQuant\nThe 60-day realized value to market capitalization variance (RCV) is a metric that calculates the 60-day rolling average and standard deviation of BTC price. According to the metric, whenever the RCV value is below 0.30, it indicates a low-risk investment in the asset. A value between 0.30-0.50 implies a neutral environment, and above 0.5 means a high sell-off risk.\u00a0\nThe analyst pointed out that the metric has been historically accurate in identifying undervaluation and overvaluation trends for BTC, and the current normalized RCV value presents a favorable buying opportunity based on \u201chistorical risk-reward dynamics.\u201d The BTC proponent added,\nIn 2024, the RCV value flashed a DCA signal between May and July, where Bitcoin fluctuated between $70,000 and $50,000. Thus, it is essential to note that the RCV does not signal a bottom but highlights the low-risk, high probability of making gains in the long term.\u00a0\nCrypto analyst Yonsei Dent pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s short-term holder SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio), which monitors realized profit or losses, had reached a sharp deviation below the lower Bolling Band.\u00a0\nBitcoin SOPR range deviation data.

Whenever these addresses accumulate, Bitcoin progressively increases in value.\n\u00a0\nBitcoin whales and sharks accumulation chart by Santiment.
