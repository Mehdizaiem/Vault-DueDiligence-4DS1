Critics, including venture capitalist Nic Carter, described it as a government effort to pressure banks into cutting ties with cryptocurrency firms.\nDespite recent regulatory shifts, agencies like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) continue to \u201cresist basic transparency\u201d efforts, Grewal wrote in a March 8 post on X.\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t gotten the message,\u201d he wrote.\nSource: Paul Grewal\nCoinbase has requested that the FDIC provide details in court on how it conducted \u201cdue diligence\u201d to ensure no documentation related to the event was destroyed. However, the agency \u201crepeatedly refused to do so,\u201d Grewal said.\nHis comments come a day after the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) eased its stance on how banks can engage with crypto just hours after US President Donald Trump vowed to end the prolonged crackdown restricting crypto firms\u2019 access to banking services.\nTrump\u2019s remarks were made during the White House Crypto Summit, where he told industry leaders he was \u201cending Operation Chokepoint 2.0.\u201d\nSource: Elon Musk\nAt least 30 tech and crypto founders were \u201csecretly debanked\u201d in the US during Operation Chokepoint 2.0, Cointelegraph reported in November 2024.\nRelated: FDIC chair, \u2018architect of Operation Chokepoint 2.0\u2019 Martin Gruenberg to resign Jan. 19\nGrewal claimed the FDIC has also not fully cooperated with Coinbase\u2019s documentation requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA):\nMoreover, Grewal said the FDIC has redacted a total of 53 pages, with many other pages containing \u201cheavy redactions rendering the documents unintelligible.\u201d\nGrewal added that his team requested that the FDIC give a \u201csworn testimony\u201d to the court.\nOn March 4, Coinbase also\u00a0submitted\u00a0a\u00a0FOIA request to\u00a0the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to find out how many investigations and enforcement actions were brought against crypto firms between April 17, 2021, and Jan. 20, 2025.\nRelated: Paolo Ardoino: Competitors and politicians intend to \u2018kill Tether\u2019\nTrump previously signed an executive order to end some banking challenges for Web3 companies and create clearer regulations for digital assets, Cointelegraph reported on Jan. 24.\nThe executive order excludes the US Federal Reserve and FDIC from cryptocurrency working groups, in a move that may put an end to the previous crypto industry debanking efforts, according to Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank.\nMagazine:\u00a0 Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom\n","date":1741454976341,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-03-08T17:29:36.341824"}
