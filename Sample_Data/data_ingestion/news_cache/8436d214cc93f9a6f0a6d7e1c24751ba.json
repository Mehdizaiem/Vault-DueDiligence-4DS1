It\u2019s sum 0,\u201d Hoskinson said at Paris Blockchain Week on April 9. \u201cInstead of picking a fight, what you have to do is you have to find tokenomics and market structure that allows you to be in a cooperative equilibrium.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t build a global ecosystem this way, and you can\u2019t win this way,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause here\u2019s the thing. The incumbents are much larger.\u201d\nMagazine: Your AI \u2018digital twin\u2019 can take meetings and comfort your loved ones\n","date":1745068597495,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-04-19T13:16:37.495608"}
