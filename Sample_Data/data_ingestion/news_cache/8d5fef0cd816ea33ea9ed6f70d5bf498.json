Source: BTC Frame\nThe differences result from the varying approaches used to calculate hashrate \u2014 such as when block times and difficulty adjustments are measured, which Bitcoin nodes and miner pools are used to pull data from and more.\nBitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp also previously pointed out that estimating Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate with one \u201ctrailing block\u201d as opposed to five can result in a difference of over 0.04 ZH\/s.\n\u201cViewing the raw Hashrate metric can be deceiving due to random variations in block times,\u201d added Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew, who pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day moving average hashrate is still around 0.845 ZH\/s mark in a note to Cointelegraph.\nDespite the discrepancies, the feat highlights the massive amount of computational power and increasing decentralization of the Bitcoin network, making it more secure than ever and significantly reducing the likelihood of a 51% attack.\nThe Bitcoin network\u2019s reported rise to 1 ZH\/s \u2014 equivalent to 1,000 Exahashes per second \u2014 marks a 1,000x increase since late January 2016, when Bitcoin first hit 1 EH\/s for the first time.\u00a0\nThe second-largest proof-of-work crypto network, Litecoin, currently boasts a hashrate of 2.49 Petahashes per second according to Coinwarz \u2014 making it around 40,000 times less computationally powerful than Bitcoin.\nSource: Pierre Rochard\nAskew noted that the huge rise in hashrate has coincided with more commercial Bitcoin mining firms competing to solve Bitcoin blocks in recent years.\n\u201cMiners are doubling down: expanding sites and plugging in more efficient machines,\u201d Askew said, adding that less efficient miners could soon be washed out unless Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price rallies again in the coming months.\nMARA Holdings is the largest Bitcoin miner with more than 50 EH\/s of compute power, while the largest share of hashrate is channeled to Bitcoin mining pools Foundry USA Pool and AntPool, according to the Hashrate Index.\nRelated: Bitcoin price drops below $80K as stocks face 1987 Black Monday rerun\nAt least 24 publicly listed Bitcoin companies have machines set up to mine Bitcoin, according to CompaniesMarketCap.com.\u00a0\nAmong the other large miners contributing hashrate are Riot Platforms, Core Scientific, CleanSpark, Hut 8 Mining and TeraWulf.\nThe new all-time high in Bitcoin hashrate came in the middle of a sharp market downturn \u2014 with Bitcoin (BTC) falling nearly 10% over the last four days to $78,750, while US stocks saw an estimated $6.6 trillion loss on April 3 and 4 \u2014 the largest two-day loss ever.\nMuch of the fall has been attributed to US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans, which many industry analysts say are sparking recession fears.\nMagazine: Financial nihilism in crypto is over \u2014 It\u2019s time to dream big again\n","date":1744039781750,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-04-07T15:29:41.750948"}
