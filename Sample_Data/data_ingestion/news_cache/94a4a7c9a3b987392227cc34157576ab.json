The CoinShares Crypto Miners ETF (WGMI) \u2014 which tracks a diverse basket of Bitcoin mining stocks \u2014 has lost roughly 13% of its value since immediately prior to Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement, according to data from Morningstar.\u00a0\nEven Strategy, one of the best-performing stocks of 2024, wasn\u2019t immune. Its share price has fallen by around 6% on the news, Google Finance data showed.\nAccording to Reuters, investment bank JPMorgan has raised its estimated odds of a global economic recession in 2025 to 60% from 40% previously.\u00a0\n\"Disruptive U.S. policies have been recognized as the biggest risk to the global outlook all year,\" JP Morgan reportedly said.\n\"The effect ... is likely to be magnified through (tariff) retaliation, a slide in U.S. business sentiment and supply-chain disruptions.\"\nStrategy\u2019s shares also dropped this week.

Stablecoin issuer Circle has reportedly paused plans for a 2025 IPO, citing market turbulence.\u00a0\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Circle is \u201cwaiting anxiously\u201d before taking further steps after filing to take the company public on April 1.\u00a0\nIt is among several companies \u2014 including fintech Klarna and ticketing service StubHub \u2014 reportedly considering altering or shelving IPO plans.\u00a0\nOne exception may be Bitcoin itself, which some analysts say is finally \u201cdecoupling\u201d from the broader market. \nBitcoin\u2019s spot price has held above $82,000 this week, even as US equities markets collapsed.\nMagazine:\u00a0Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom\n","date":1743859909600,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-04-05T13:31:49.600676"}
