Will 2021 prices return? \nBitcoin (BTC) is turning back the clock this week as tariff mayhem drags BTC price action toward 2021.\nBitcoin is giving up bull market support lines left and right as a new \u201cdeath cross\u201d completes on the BTC\/USD daily chart.\nCPI week is firmly overshadowed by US trade tariffs and their increasingly global impact on stock markets.\nBoth crypto and TradFi market participants are drawing comparisons to \u201cBlack Monday\u201d 1987 and the COVID-19 cross-market crash.\nBitcoin\u2019s speculative investor base is firmly out of pocket and likely increasingly tempted to panic sell.\nSentiment everywhere is nonexistent, with the TradFi Fear & Greed Index recording its lowest score in history.\nBitcoin risks falling below its old all-time highs from March 2024 next, Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\nBTC\/USD 1-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nAfter slipping below $75,000 for the first time since November, BTC\/USD is rapidly reawakening long-forgotten bull market support lines. These include $69,000, a level that first appeared in 2021.\nThe dive, which came as a copycat move several days after stock markets began to suffer major losses, caught many by surprise.\nIs our uncorrelated hedge in the room right now?\n\u201cThis is $ BTC\u2019s last chance to maintain its macro uptrend structure,\u201d analyst Kevin Svenson summarized in a warning on X.\nBTC\/USD 1-day chart.

This typical bearish signal involves the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crossing below its 200-day equivalent.\n\u201cThe momentum carrying through that Death Cross, puts BTC at a critical macro support test,\u201d it told X followers.\u00a0\nBTC\/USD 1-day chart with 50, 200 SMA. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingView\nLike last week, US trade tariffs are the major talking point across financial markets worldwide.\nThe impact of measures announced last week continues to be felt, as downside momentum on risk assets now becomes fueled by the prospect of more tariffs set for release on April 9.\nSpeaking to mainstream media over the weekend, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that the US government would go ahead with the measures without delay.\n\u201cThe tariffs are coming,\u201d he told CBS News.\nWith sentiment diving and panic among market participants from trading desks to hedge funds, little attention is paid to the week\u2019s other potential volatility catalysts.\nThese will come in the form of US inflation data, itself a key topic as tariffs risk causing unexpected price growth.\nThe March prints of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) are due on April 10 and 11, respectively.\nPreviously, Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said that while tariffs would have a palpable effect on the US inflation battle, it would be difficult to assess this accurately in advance.\n\u201cAs the new policies and their likely economic effects become clear, we will have a better sense of the implications for the economy and for monetary policy,\u201d he subsequently said during a speech last week.\nFed target rate probability comparison for May FOMC meeting.

Source: Polymarket\nIn the short term, the \u201ceffects\u201d of tariffs are feared to include a marketwide crash similar to \u201cBlack Monday\u201d in 1987.\u00a0\nAs Cointelegraph reported, market responses to the first round of reciprocal tariffs laid the foundations for turmoil at the upcoming Wall Street open.\nA 10% dip in two consecutive days has only happened for the fourth time in history.October 1987.October 2008.March 2020.April 2025.In 1987 & 2020, it marked the bottom.In 2008, it took one more month to mark the bottom.\nFor trader, analyst and entrepreneur Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, crypto\u2019s Black Monday moment is already here.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see a rollercoaster 1-2 weeks in which we\u2019re having a test of the lows for Bitcoin. It can go as deep as $70K from here,\u201d he warned X followers on April 7.\nVan de Poppe saw an emergency Fed rate cut as the only logical escape path for stemming the risk-asset bleed.\nBTC\/USDT 1-day chart with RSI data.

In fact, we may be nearing investor panic levels ABOVE March 2020,\u201d it added.\u00a0\nOn Bitcoin, the investor cohort likely first to capitulate are short-term holders (STHs), the market\u2019s more speculative entities with a buy-in date within the last six months.\nAs Cointelegraph reported, these investors are highly sensitive to BTC price volatility, and that their panic selling creates a vicious circle for the market.\nData from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant now shows that the STH cohort is falling increasingly into the red.\nThe Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric, which tracks STH coins moving in profit or loss, is currently below breakeven.\n\u201cWhen STH-SOPR falls below 1.0, it reflects that short-term investors are realizing losses \u2014 a classic signal of capitulation,\u201d CryptoQuant contributor Yonsei Dent noted in one of its \u201cQuicktake\u201d blog posts.\nBitcoin STH-SOPR chart.

Source: Alternative.me\nBeyond the panic, some voices are cautiously hinting that now is an ideal moment to \u201cbuy the dip,\u201d whether on stocks or crypto.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the absolute bottom is in, but is generally at least a local opportunity,\u201d Charles Edwards, the founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, argued in an X thread.\nEdwards tallied up both bullish and bearish arguments, and concluded that much risk remained, especially to Bitcoin\u2019s bull market.\n\u201cTo be fair Bitcoin did very well last week, but has played catch up (to the downside) over the weekend. Pending some large unforeseen news, it\u2019s going to be hard for Bitcoin to fight a correlation=1 event across risk assets, we saw something similar in early 2020,\u201d he commented.\u00a0\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
