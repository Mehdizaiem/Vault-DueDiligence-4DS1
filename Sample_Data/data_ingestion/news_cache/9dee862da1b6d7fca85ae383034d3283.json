Traders now shift their hope to the resumption of QE and expanding global liquidity. \nFinancial markets are sending mixed signals as uncertainty reaches new highs. On Feb. 25, the US debt ceiling was raised from $36.1 trillion to $40.1 trillion, marking another massive expansion in government borrowing.\nFollowing a historical pattern, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield reacted to the news by dropping from 4.4% to 4.29%. While this may seem counterintuitive, markets tend to interpret debt ceiling resolutions as stabilizing events, reducing near-term uncertainty even if they imply higher borrowing down the line.\nHowever, the stock and crypto markets, which usually benefit from lower bond yields as capital rotates into risk assets, have continued their fall that started last week. Since Feb. 21, the S&P 500 has lost 3%, the Nasdaq100 has dropped 5%, and Bitcoin has plunged 16%. The leading cryptocurrency is now trading 26% below its all-time high reached on President Donald Trump\u2019s Inauguration Day, effectively erasing the Trump pump.\u00a0\nA simultaneous decline in stocks and bond yields is not typical market behavior and suggests growing risk aversion and economic slowdown fears.\u00a0\nRecent US economic data released on Feb. 21 has shown notable signs of weakness. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index fell to 64.7 in February, down from 71.7 in January. This marks the lowest level since November 2023 and came in below the preliminary estimate of 67.8, which was also the consensus forecast among economists polled by Reuters.\u00a0\nExisting home sales dropped 4.9%, and the S&P Global Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) fell from 52.7 in January to 50.4, the lowest since Sept. 2023. PMI tracks manufacturing and services activity, and a reading barely above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction indicates stagnating growth in the private sector.\nTrade tensions add to market uncertainty. On Feb. 24, Trump said that tariffs on Canada and Mexico \u201cwill go forward\u201d after the deadline for the monthlong delay ends next week. Trump\u2019s plan to impose 25% tariffs on the European Union, revealed on Feb. 26, and an additional 10% levy on Chinese goods added to the growing market anxiety\u00a0\nIn commentary to CNBC, Chris Rupkey, Chief Economist at FWDBonds, unapologetically said,\u00a0\nRupkey elaborated, \u201cThe economy is coming in for a crash landing this year. Bet on it. The bond market is.\u201d\u00a0\nIn the crypto market, the Fear & Greed Index has plunged to 10, or Extreme Fear - a stark contrast to the Greed levels seen at the beginning of February.\nCrypto Fear & Greed Index. Source: alternative.me\nIn January, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes speculated that a battle over the debt ceiling\u2014combined with a reluctance to spend down the Treasury General Account\u2014could push 10-year Treasury yields above 5%, triggering a stock market crash and forcing the the Federal Reserve to intervene.\u00a0\nIn his view, this could help President Trump to pressure the Fed into adopting a mode dovish stance. In other words, a small crisis to justify the QE and stimulate the economy.\u00a0\nFor Hayes, this mini-crisis must occur early in Trump\u2019s presidency, during\u00a0 Q1 or Q2, so he could blame it on the leverage built up during the Biden administration.\u00a0\nIronically, even though the debt ceiling was raised with minimal drama, and 10-year Treasury yields have actually fallen, the stock market still dropped. The most pressing question now is whether this will lead to interest rate cuts.\nThe Fed remains neutral, with recent economic data providing little reason for an imminent policy shift. The latest CPI report on Feb. 11 showed inflation accelerating to 0.5% month-over-month, pushing the annual rate to 3%, both exceeding expectations. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that the central bank won\u2019t rush to cut rates further. Despite this position, a combination of weakening economic indicators and liquidity expansion may eventually force the Fed\u2019s hand later this year.\nRelated: Short-term crypto traders sent record 79.3K Bitcoin to exchanges as BTC crashed to $86K\nDespite the current market downturn, not all hope is lost, as a massive wave of liquidity expansion could be on the horizon. The expanding M2 global liquidity supply could breathe fresh air into the risk-on markets, especially Bitcoin. However, this might take some time.\nThe M2 Global Liquidity Index 3-Month Offset provides a useful framework for forecasting liquidity-driven market movements. This indicator shifts M2 money supply data forward by three months to analyze its relationship with risk assets.\nCrypto analyst Crypto Rover highlighted this on X, stating:\nBitcoin vs M2 Global Liquidity Index (3M offset). Source: CryptoRover\nThe historical performance shows that BTC usually lags approximately 60 days behind major global liquidity movements. The current drop inscribes perfectly into this picture, which also promises a strong rebound by June if liquidity trends hold.\nJeff Park, head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, echoed the sentiment:\u00a0\nJamie Coutts, a crypto analyst from Realvision, also shared his views on how liquidity expansion impacts Bitcoin price.\u00a0\nMacro and Liquidity Dashboard.
