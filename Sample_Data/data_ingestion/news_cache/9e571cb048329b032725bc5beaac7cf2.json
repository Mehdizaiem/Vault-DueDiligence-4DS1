The act aims to establish collateralization guidelines and require full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws from stablecoin issuers.\nRelated: $400M Web3 investment fund ABCDE halts new investments, fundraising\nThe BIS also raised concerns about how crypto markets may worsen income inequality by enabling larger investors to capitalize on the emotions of less sophisticated retail participants, as seen during the FTX collapse in 2022.\n\u201cAs prices tumbled in 2022, users actually traded more,\u201d the BIS report noted. \u201cMost disturbingly, large bitcoin holders (\u201cwhales\u201d) were selling as ordinary retail investors (\u201ckrill\u201d) were buying.\u201d It added:\nThe report concludes that DeFi and TradFi have similar underlying economic drivers, but DeFi\u2019s \u201cdistinctive features,\u201d like \u201csmart contract and composability,\u201d present new challenges that need proactive regulatory interventions to \u201csafeguard financial stability, while fostering innovation.\u201d\nMagazine: Uni students crypto \u2018grooming\u2019 scandal, 67K scammed by fake women: Asia Express\n","date":1745068593742,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-04-19T13:16:33.742578"}
