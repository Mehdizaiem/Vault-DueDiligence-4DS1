The shift follows recent disappointment tied to memecoin launches associated with US President Donald Trump.\nThe industry\u2019s most successful cryptocurrency traders by returns \u2014 tracked as \u201csmart money\u201d traders on Nansen\u2019s blockchain intelligence platform \u2014 continue hunting for quick memecoin returns.\nWhile growing stablecoin holdings show increased caution, smart money remains open to speculative plays, according to Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at Nansen.\n\u201cThere was the recent meme surge and smart money is always happy to capitulate on that. But they\u2019re also happy to rotate out of these quickly as well,\u201d he said during Cointelegraph\u2019s Chainreaction live show on X.\n\u201cThe recent meme frenzy was just a fun play they worked on, while the broader market is sorting out the direction because memecoins aren\u2019t necessarily affected by the same macroeconomy as Bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d he added.\nRelated: Bitcoin holds firm as stocks lose $5T in record Trump tariff sell-off\nThe analyst\u2019s insights came a week after a savvy trader turned an initial investment of just $2,000 into $43 million with the popular Pepe (PEPE) cryptocurrency, Cointelegraph reported on March 30.\nSavvy Pepe trader, transactions.

Total active wallets on Pump.fun fell from 2.85 million on the week of Jan. 20 to just 1.44 million as of March 31.\nThe decline is mainly attributed to a decay in investor sentiment, a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\u201cBroader macroeconomic uncertainty, including volatility driven by global tariff policies, may have further dampened speculative appetite for memecoins more generally,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nTRUMP\/USD, all-time chart.
