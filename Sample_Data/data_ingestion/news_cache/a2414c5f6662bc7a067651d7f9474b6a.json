The Bitcoin (BTC) reserve will be seeded with BTC forfeited to federal agencies through civil or criminal asset seizures.\nWhite House AI and crypto czar David Sacks described the reserve as a \u201cdigital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency,\u201d saying that the US will not sell any BTC held in the reserve. \u201cIt will be kept as a store of value,\u201d Sacks added. \nSacks previously lamented the US government\u2019s sales of 195,000 BTC for $366 million. The official said the BTC sold by the US government could\u2019ve gone for billions if it had only held on to the assets.\u00a0\nThe reserve will initially be seeded by the BTC kept by the Treasury, while the other federal agencies will \u201cevaluate their legal authority\u201d to transfer their BTC into the reserve.\u00a0\nRegarding the digital asset stockpile, Sacks said it would promote \u201cresponsible stewardship\u201d of the government\u2019s crypto assets under the Treasury. This includes potential sales from the stockpiles.\u00a0\nOn March 2, Trump said that the crypto reserve would include assets like XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). The president later added Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) to his crypto reserves list.\u00a0\nRelated: 10-year Treasury yield falls to 4% as DXY softens \u2014 Is it time to buy the Bitcoin price dip?\nWhile Trump\u2019s election may have positively impacted crypto markets, the US president\u2019s next move has resulted in a market crash.\u00a0\nOn April 5, the Trump administration hit all countries with a 10% tariff. Some countries were given higher rates, including China at 34% and Japan at 24%. The European Union was also hit with a 20% tariff.\u00a0\u00a0\nFollowing Trump\u2019s move, the overall crypto market capitalization declined by over 8%, slipping to $2.5 trillion.\u00a0\nMagazine: Financial nihilism in crypto is over \u2014 It\u2019s time to dream big again\n\n","date":1744039767896,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-04-07T15:29:27.896649"}
