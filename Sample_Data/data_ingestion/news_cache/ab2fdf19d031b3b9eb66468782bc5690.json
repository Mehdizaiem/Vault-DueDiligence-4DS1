Source: X\nBitcoin has experienced significant drawdowns in past cycles, with a notable 83% drop from its peak in 2018 and a 73% correction from all-time highs (ATH) in 2022. In comparison, the current decline of 26.62%, while substantial, remains less severe than previous bear markets. \nThis suggests that even though the current downturn is impactful, it has not yet reached the intensity of previous cycles. However, crypto and macro resource \u2018ecoinometrics\u2019 said that Bitcoin might struggle to stage an immediate turnaround. The analysts explained, \nBitcoin and Nasdaq correlation.

A weekly close below the 50-W EMA has signaled the beginning of a bear market in previous market cycles. \nBitcoin weekly chart.

However, the daily demand zone between $65,000 and $69,000 could be a bigger liquidity level based on its significance. The $69,000 level is also the 2021 all-time high price. \nAdditionally, Bitcoin\u2019s weekly relative strength index, RSI, reached its lowest value of 43 since January 2023 at the end of Q1. In August 2023 and September 2024, the RSI recovered from a similar value to trigger a price recovery for Bitcoin. In 2022, when RSI dropped below 40, bears took total control of the market. \nAnonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital also predicted based on daily RSI value and said: \nRelated: Bitcoin, stocks crumble after \u201890 day tariff pause\u2019 deemed fake news \u2014 BTC whales keep accumulating\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
