Now, this cash and carry trade is \u201cimploding,\u201d he said.\nSource: Kyle Chass\u00e9\nThe cash and carry trade involved buying spot Bitcoin ETFs and shorting Bitcoin futures on CME, which allowed traders to earn up to 5.68% in annualized returns by Chass\u00e9\u2019s calculation.\u00a0\nThe success of this trade depended mainly on Bitcoin futures trading at a premium to the cryptocurrency\u2019s spot price. However, \u201cwith recent market weakness, that premium has collapsed,\u201d said Chass\u00e9.\nWith the trade no longer profitable, hedge funds are exiting the market, which is evidenced by the record outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs this week.\n\u201cThe same trade that kept Bitcoin stable on the way up is accelerating the crash now,\u201d he said. This is happening because \u201chedge funds don\u2019t care about Bitcoin. They weren\u2019t betting on BTC mooning. They were farming low-risk yield.\u201d\nRelated: Bitcoin futures and spot ETF traders capitulate as BTC looks for a bottom\nBitcoin\u2019s sell-off accelerated on Feb. 27, as the cryptocurrency retraced all the way back to the sub-$79,000 region for the first time in more than three months.\nHowever, a closer look at onchain data reveals that the losses are mainly concentrated among Bitcoin tourists, or new traders who only entered the market recently.\u00a0\nData from Glassnode shows that 74% of the realized losses came from holders who bought in the last month.\u00a0\nSource: Carl B Menger\nNevertheless, unrealized losses from the recent sell-off exceeded crypto exchange FTX\u2019s capitulation event, according to analyst Milkybull Crypto. A drop of this magnitude is a strong sign of a bottom formation in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\u00a0\nMagazine: 3AC-related OX.FUN denies insolvency rumors, Bybit goes to war: Asia Express\n","date":1740785877120,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-02-28T23:37:57.120348"}
