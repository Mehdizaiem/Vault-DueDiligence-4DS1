It stated:\nA spokesperson for OKX did not respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s request to comment on whether the exchange admitted to such wrongdoing in the past.\n\u201cWith this chapter behind us, OKX remains focused on the future \u2014 continuing to build a secure, transparent, and compliant platform for our users worldwide,\u201d the representative said.\nThe news on the $1.2 million penalty in Malta came soon after Bloomberg in March reported that European Union regulators were probing OKX over its potential role in facilitating the laundering of $100 million in funds from the Bybit hack.\nBybit CEO Ben Zhou previously claimed that OKX\u2019s Web3 proxy allowed hackers to launder roughly $100 million, or 40,233 Ether (ETH), from the $1.5 billion hack, which occurred in February 2025.\nRelated: Binance ends Tether USDT trading in Europe to comply with MiCA rules\nIn response to Zhou\u2019s allegations, OKX denied claims that there were any ongoing investigations by the EU authorities, adding that \u201cBybit\u2019s statements are spreading misinformation.\u201d\nSource: OKX\nThe latest news from Malta\u2019s FIAU also followed recent reports suggesting that OKX hired former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to advise it over the federal criminal investigation leading to its plea and a $505 million penalty payment in the US.\nOKX\u2019s new penalty in Malta sets a precedent in the context of regulators dealing with past compliance violations by MiCA-licensed companies, showing that the license does not spare the firms from responsibility for past breaches.\nMagazine: Stablecoin for cyber-scammers launches, Sony L2 drama: Asia Express\n\n","date":1743782404031,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-04-04T16:00:04.031976"}
