The move, in partnership with payments provider Transak, is aimed at simplifying the process of converting digital assets into traditional currency.\nMetaMask users were previously forced to swap assets into Ether (ETH) tokens before being able to convert them into fiat money, adding extra steps and transaction fees.\nHowever, as part of MetaMask\u2019s ongoing partnership with Transak, the wallet will add support to 10 new networks: the Arbitrum mainnet, Avalanche C-Chain mainnet, Base, BNB Chain, Celo, Fantom, Moonbeam, Moonriver, Optimism and Polygon.\nThe first four tokens to receive immediate off-ramping support include ETH on Ethereum, ETH on Optimisim, BNB (BNB) and the Polygon (POL) token. Support for the additional six networks will be gradually rolled out.\n\u201cBy expanding off-ramping capabilities with Transak, MetaMask is removing barriers between crypto and traditional currency, allowing users to convert a broader range of tokens directly to cash,\u201d said Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys.\nContinue reading\nAccording to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, most of the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ended the week in the red.\nThe Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium\u2019s (RAY) token fell over 55% as the week\u2019s biggest loser, followed by the Lido DAO (LDO) token, down over 34% on the weekly chart.\nTotal value locked in DeFi.
