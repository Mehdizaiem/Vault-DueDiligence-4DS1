Sygnum Bank estimates that the US Bitcoin reserve could grow BTC\u2019s market capitalization by roughly 25%, or approximately $460 billion.\nUS Treasury convertible foreign reserves.

Source: Arkham Intelligence\nLummis had previously argued that the US Treasury should convert some of its assets to purchase BTC but did not specify which assets should be converted.\nWhite House adviser David Sacks also called Bitcoin digital gold and the recently established Bitcoin strategic reserve \u201ca digital Fort Knox\u201d for the supply-capped, decentralized cryptocurrency.\nSacks added that the scarce nature of BTC sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies as a unique store of value.\nMagazine: Bitcoin vs. the quantum computer threat: Timeline and solutions (2025\u20132035)\n","date":1741454994686,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-03-08T17:29:54.686458"}
