The Swiss branch has since broadened its offerings to include Ether and the USDC (USDC) stablecoin.\nIn January 2025, BBVA\u2019s Turkish subsidiary Garanti BBVA Kripto launched its crypto trading services to the public. With Spain now entering the fold, BBVA is broadening its crypto services in line with evolving European regulations.\nBBVA\u2019s expansion comes as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) reached full implementation at the end of 2024. While the framework is now in effect, crypto companies in the EU have until July 2026 to fully comply with its requirements under an 18-month transitional phase.\nThe grandfather period, or transitional phase, for crypto firms to become MiCA-compliant lasts until July 2026.

Prime brokerage Hidden Road obtained its MiCA license in the Netherlands on Dec. 30, 2024. Standard Chartered followed on Jan. 9, receiving approval in Luxembourg, while Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody became Germany\u2019s first MiCA-licensed crypto service provider on Jan. 17.\nCrypto-native companies are also adjusting to the new regulatory landscape. In January 2025, major exchanges OKX, Crypto.com and HashKey all secured MiCA approval. Bybit, which suffered the largest hack in crypto history, was recently removed from France\u2019s blacklist and has expressed intent to obtain a MiCA license next.\nMagazine: SEC\u2019s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered\u00a0\n","date":1741616544574,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-03-10T14:22:24.574496"}
