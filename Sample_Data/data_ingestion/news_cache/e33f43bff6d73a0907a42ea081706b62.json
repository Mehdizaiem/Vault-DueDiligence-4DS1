With China out of the picture post-2021 crackdown, and Washington now openly exploring the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, America\u2019s place in the global mining ecosystem is under transformation.\nStill, size isn\u2019t everything. Genoot emphasized that efficiency and cost-effectiveness are core to the strategy.\nRelated: Bitcoin miner Hut 8 argues to toss \u2018short and distort\u2019 shareholder suit\nAmerican Bitcoin\u2019s structure allows it to mine BTC at low cost, accumulate more when the market allows, and potentially expand into other Bitcoin ecosystem services. Hut 8 currently holds over 10,000 BTC on its balance sheet, worth up to $1 billion depending on market conditions. American Bitcoin aims to surpass that.\nAnd the company isn\u2019t just bullish on Bitcoin; it\u2019s bullish on power consumption. Genoot pushed back on criticism that mining wastes energy:\u00a0\nLooking ahead, Hut 8\u2019s mining spinoff has big ambitions. \u201cOur focus is scaling. Our focus is taking this company public on a US exchange,\u201d Genoot said. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear more from us soon.\u201d\nListen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph\u2019s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.
