As an example, she pointed to a potential repeat of the five years leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis, which she believes could be favorable for Bitcoin.\nRelated: Bitcoin whales absorb 300% of newly mined BTC supply \u2014 Is $100K next?\nShe pointed to the 2003\u20132007 period, where there was a weaker US dollar cycle, and while there wasn\u2019t a mass exodus of capital, it did flow into \u201cemerging markets,\u201d commodities, gold, and other assets \u2014 with US stocks not \u201creally being the place to be.\u201d\nAlden wrote in a September research report that Bitcoin moves in the direction of global M2 83% of the time in a given 12-month period. \nThe research termed \u201cBitcoin a Global Liquidity Barometer\u201d compared Bitcoin to other major asset classes such as SPX, gold and VT, and BTC topped the correlation index concerning global liquidity.\nMagazine: Uni students crypto \u2018grooming\u2019 scandal, 67K scammed by fake women: Asia Express\n","date":1745068605136,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-04-19T13:16:45.136271"}
