Layer-2 (L2) solutions have fractured liquidity, making capital inefficient. In search of greener pastures, the community has turned to Solana \u2014 only to find a memecoin-driven ecosystem fueled by pump-and-dump schemes, attracting liquidity extractors, and turning the chain into a playground for speculation and fraud.\nDeFi needs a reset that returns to first principles and aligns with Satoshi\u2019s original vision of a decentralized financial system. The only network capable of sustaining the next evolution of DeFi isn\u2019t Ethereum or Solana. It\u2019s Bitcoin.\nEthereum was once the undisputed home of DeFi, but today, it\u2019s clear that the ecosystem is struggling. The network\u2019s roadmap constantly changes, with no clear path toward long-term sustainability.\nL2 solutions were supposed to scale Ethereum. Instead, they\u2019ve fractured DeFi into isolated liquidity silos. While L2s have lowered transaction fees, they now compete for liquidity rather than contributing to a unified financial system. The result? A fragmented landscape that makes capital inefficient and DeFi protocols harder to scale.\nEthereum\u2019s proposed solution \u2014 chain abstraction \u2014 sounds promising in theory but fails in practice. The fundamental issue is a structural misalignment of incentives, and as a result, Ethereum is gradually losing its competitive edge in DeFi.\nIt\u2019s time to ask: Can DeFi\u2019s future lie in a fragmented Ethereum?\nWith Ethereum losing its competitive edge, many developers and users have turned to Solana. The blockchain has seen an 83% increase in developer activity year-over-year, and its decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have outperformed Ethereum\u2019s for five consecutive months.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a fundamental problem: Solana\u2019s DeFi growth isn\u2019t built on sustainable financial applications \u2014 a memecoin frenzy fuels it.\nThe recent surge in activity isn\u2019t driven by innovation in decentralized finance but by speculative trades. Following the TRUMP memecoin craze, the total extracted value from Solana\u2019s memecoins ranged between $3.6 billion and $6.6 billion. This isn\u2019t DeFi growth \u2014 it\u2019s a liquidity extraction engine where short-term speculators cash in and move on.\nSolana has real strengths. Its speed and low transaction costs make it ideal for high-frequency trading, and its ecosystem has made meaningful strides in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), AI and decentralized science, or DeSci. But the dominance of memecoin speculation has turned the chain into a playground for fraud and pump-and-dump schemes. That\u2019s not the foundation DeFi needs.\nSolana isn\u2019t the answer if the goal is to build a lasting financial system.\nIt\u2019s time to return to first principles and build DeFi on the original blockchain: Bitcoin \u2014 the most trusted, decentralized network backed by the soundest money in the digital economy.\nThis is not just theoretical. Bitcoin DeFi is already experiencing explosive growth. Consider the numbers: Total value locked (TVL) in Bitcoin DeFi surged from $300 million in early 2024 to $5.4 billion as of Feb. 28, 2025 \u2014 a staggering 1,700% increase. The Bitcoin staking sector is dominating, with protocols like Babylon ($4.68 billion TVL), Lombard ($1.59 billion) and SolvBTC ($715 million) leading the charge. This demonstrates the growing demand for Bitcoin to become a productive asset rather than a passive store of value.\nRecent: Bitcoin DeFi takes center stage\nBitcoin-native DeFi isn\u2019t simply copying Ethereum\u2019s playbook \u2014 it\u2019s pioneering new financial models. Advancements in the space have introduced dual staking, allowing users to stake Bitcoin (BTC) alongside native tokens to enhance security and earn yields. Meanwhile, novel approaches to tokenizing Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate turn mining power into collateral for lending, borrowing and staking, further expanding Bitcoin\u2019s financial utility.\nIn addition, Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens have driven record-high transaction activity, with inscriptions reaching 66.7 million and generating $420 million in fees \u2014 highlighting the growing demand for tokenized assets on Bitcoin.\nIt is clear that Bitcoin is no longer just digital gold \u2014 it\u2019s becoming the foundation for the next phase of decentralized finance.\nThe future of DeFi lies with Bitcoin, where incentives align with long-term value creation. Unlike Ethereum\u2019s fragmented model and Solana\u2019s speculative economy, Bitcoin-based DeFi is built on institutional-grade liquidity and sustainable growth.\nAs the largest and most liquid crypto asset, Bitcoin boasts a $1.7 trillion market cap and $94 billion in exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings. Even a fraction of this liquidity migrating into DeFi would be a game-changer. Bitcoin holds over $1 trillion in untapped liquidity and continues to attract strong interest from institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds, with governments already exploring it as a potential reserve asset.\nSeveral projects are already building on Bitcoin, building a sustainable ecosystem where users can hold the most trusted digital asset while making it productive through DeFi mechanisms.\u00a0\nEthereum had its moment. Solana had its hype. It\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s turn to actualize Satoshi\u2019s original vision of a decentralized financial system.\nOpinion by: Matt Mudano, CEO of Arch Labs.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
