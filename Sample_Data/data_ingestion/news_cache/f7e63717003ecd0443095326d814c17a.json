They will be accounted for. Most Europeans will see taxation,\u201d Radin told Cointelegraph.\nRelated: 20% of Gen Z, Alpha sees crypto as retirement alternative: Report\nThe regulation also raises the possibility of enforcement actions against blockchain protocols that fail to comply with MiCA standards. European governments may pursue legal cases against noncompliant platforms during the early implementation phase.\nOther blockchain regulatory experts fear that MiCA will introduce consolidation among crypto firms with limited capital, leading to a potential crypto firm exodus to the Middle East due to more lenient regulations.\nMagazine: SEC\u2019s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered\n","date":1741691695652,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-03-11T11:14:55.652719"}
