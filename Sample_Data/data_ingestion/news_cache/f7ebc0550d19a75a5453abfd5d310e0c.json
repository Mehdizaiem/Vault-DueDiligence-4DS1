According to Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cbull score index,\u201d investor sentiment is showing its lowest reading in two years.\u00a0\nBitcoin bull score index.

The bull score remained above 40 throughout 2024, only dipping below this threshold in February 2025, as identified in the chart above.\u00a0\nHowever, over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price has displayed resilience when compared against the massive losses seen in the US stock market. On April 3, Bitcoin closed the day with a green candle, while the S&P 500 was down 4.5%, a historic first.  \nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones extended their decline on April 4, dropping 3.87% and 3.44%, respectively, while Bitcoin held steady near the breakeven point. \nRelated: Arthur Hayes loves tariffs as printed money pain is good for Bitcoin\nData from CryptoQuant indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s Value Days Destroyed (VDD) metric currently sits around 0.72, suggesting that Bitcoin price is in a transitional phase. Since 2023, such periods have preceded either price consolidation or renewed accumulation before a bullish breakout.\nBitcoin value days destroyed.

The metric peaked at 2.27 on Dec. 12, signaling aggressive profit-taking and this dynamic matched the highs seen in 2021 and 2017. However, VDD dropped to 0.65 in April, reflecting a cooling-off period where profit-taking has subsided.\u00a0\nThis opens the possibility of a \u201crisk-on\u201d market for Bitcoin. In financial terms, a \"risk-on\" scenario occurs when investors embrace higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies, often driven by optimism and mean reversions in trends. \nAmid ongoing market uncertainty that has been fueled by the US-led trade war, Bitcoin could unexpectedly gain from these tense conditions. \nSpeaking on Bitcoin and the crypto market\u2019s potential as a hedge against traditional market volatility, crypto trader Jackis said,\u00a0\nSimilarly, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index also exhibited a \u201cfear\u201d category with a score of 28 on April 4. The index registered an \"extreme fear\" score of 25 on April 3, suggesting that the current price may present a compelling buying opportunity.\nCrypto Fear & Greed Index.
