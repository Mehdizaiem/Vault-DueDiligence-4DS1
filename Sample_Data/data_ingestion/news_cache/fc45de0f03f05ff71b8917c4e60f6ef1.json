Now \u2014 Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan explains why","url":"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/best-time-ever-to-buy-bitcoin-bitwise-matt-hougan","content":" In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, the chief investment officer discusses Bitcoin\u2019s risks, institutional adoption and why now could be the best time to invest. \nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered when is the right time to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), you won\u2019t want to miss our latest interview with Matt Hougan. As the chief investment officer at Bitwise, Hougan provides an in-depth analysis, explaining why, from a risk-adjusted perspective, there has never been a more opportune time to buy Bitcoin.\nIn our discussion, Hougan lays out a compelling argument: Bitcoin\u2019s early days were filled with uncertainty \u2014 technology risks, regulatory threats, trading inefficiencies, and reputational concerns. Fast forward to today, and those risks have significantly diminished. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs, adoption by major institutional investors, and even the US government\u2019s strategic Bitcoin reserve have all cemented its place in the global financial ecosystem. \n\u201cBitcoin is only 10% of gold. So just to match gold, which I think is just a stopping point on its long-term journey, it has to ten-x from here,\u201d he said. \nBut that\u2019s just the beginning. Hougan also touches on Bitcoin\u2019s long-term price potential, why institutional adoption is about to accelerate, and how market fundamentals could push Bitcoin to new heights. \n\u201cThere's just too much structural long-term demand that has to come into this market against a severely limited new supply,\u201d  he said.\nWatch the full interview now on our YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe! \n","date":1743688092063,"authors":[],"image_url":"","scraped_at":"2025-04-03T13:48:12.063909"}
