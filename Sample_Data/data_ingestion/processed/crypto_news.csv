Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed daily BTC price gains approaching 4%.
New four-month lows had accompanied the previous day’s Wall Street trading session as recession fears sent risk-asset investors fleeing.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index finished the day down 2.7% and 4%, respectively. At the time of writing, Nasdaq 100 futures had recovered around 0.4% from a trip to their lowest levels since September 2024.
Commenting, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter suggested that markets had entered an unsustainable downtrend.
“Are we overdue for a massive short squeeze?” it queried in a thread on X, noting risk-asset sentiment in “extreme fear” territory.

Kobeissi and others referenced unusually high readings from the VIX volatility index while making the case for a sustained recovery.
“$VIX has only been higher 11% of the time, going back to 1990,” network economist Timothy Peterson, creator of several Bitcoin price forecasting tools, continued.

d88f8bef61b870ecb5f50d0d0b486178,Cointelegraph,The strategic crypto reserve will fuel ecosystem growth,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-strategic-crypto-reserve," The US strategic crypto reserve featuring Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana and Cardano legitimizes these platforms, enabling ecosystem growth, investment and innovation across DeFi, infrastructure and blockchain gaming. 
Opinion by: Tim Haldorsson, founder of Lunar Strategy
When US President Donald Trump announced the US strategic crypto reserve on March 2, the immediate focus fell on the price surges of the included coins. Behind the market excitement lies a much bigger story that extends far beyond the named assets themselves. 
The real opportunity lies not in holding Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) — it’s in building on these newly legitimized platforms.
This government endorsement creates fertile ground for an entire ecosystem of projects, unleashing innovation across multiple sectors while creating investment opportunities that could define the next wave of blockchain adoption.
The strategic reserve announcement fundamentally changed the risk profile for projects building on these networks. Developers quietly building on Ethereum, Solana and Cardano now find themselves on government-approved foundations. This validation removes significant uncertainty — a crucial factor for attracting users and capital.
When a nation plans to hold these assets in reserve, it signals a long-term commitment to their viability. For projects building on these networks, this increases confidence that their underlying platform won’t face existential regulatory threats. Infrastructure projects particularly stand to benefit; layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, developer tooling for Solana and interoperability solutions for Cardano can now operate with greater certainty about their foundation’s future.
The early evidence already supports this shift. After the announcement, Cardano’s ecosystem saw renewed attention, with significant whale accumulation and increased trading volume across its decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Projects such as Minswap and Liqwid Finance experienced growing interest as users gained confidence in the network’s long-term viability. Ethereum and Solana ecosystems are seeing similar effects, with capital flowing to projects that leverage their unique strengths.
Not all projects will benefit equally from this validation. Specific sectors are positioned to capture disproportionate growth as retail and institutional investors recalibrate their approach to these now-endorsed chains.
DeFi applications stand out as immediate beneficiaries. With multiple networks now government-backed, crosschain DeFi protocols that facilitate liquidity between Ethereum, Solana and Cardano are seeing renewed interest. The government’s implicit endorsement of multiple chains reinforces the vision of a multichain future rather than a winner-take-all scenario.
Infrastructure projects that connect these networks will also thrive. Crosschain bridges, already vital for a fragmented blockchain landscape, become even more critical when multiple networks have official backing. Projects building on identity solutions could also see significant interest — these government-approved networks make ideal foundations for digital identity systems requiring trust and stability.
Recent: Does XRP, SOL or ADA belong in a US crypto reserve?
Finally, the blockchain gaming sector, which had already shown strong growth with 7.4 million daily active wallets by the end of 2024, could accelerate as developers flock to these legitimized platforms. Games built on Solana’s speed or Cardano’s security can point to government endorsement as a credibility booster when seeking partners or users.
For investors looking to capitalize on this ecosystem growth, several key metrics separate promising projects from mere speculation.
Total value locked (TVL) provides a window into genuine usage and trust. Projects showing significant TVL growth after the announcement demonstrate real traction. Developer activity remains another critical indicator: Ethereum remains the most important developer ecosystem, with thousands of active monthly contributors. At the same time, Solana experienced the fastest developer growth in 2024, particularly in emerging markets like India.
User adoption metrics tell an equally important story. Daily active wallets, transaction volumes and community growth reveal whether a project captures actual market share or generates hype. Strong partnerships also signal project strength — those securing collaborations with established institutions gain credibility and distribution channels.
The most promising projects combine these metrics with robust security measures and regulatory compliance — increasingly important factors now that these networks have government attention. Projects anticipating and addressing compliance requirements position themselves to benefit from institutional adoption.
Historically, government endorsements have led to increased institutional investment. The strategic reserve announcement could recalibrate how venture capital flows through the crypto ecosystem if this pattern holds. Venture capitalists, who were previously cautious about regulatory uncertainty, now have more precise signals about what networks have an unofficial blessing.
We may see venture firms double down on projects building on Ethereum, Solana and Cardano at the expense of alternative chains. New dedicated funds focusing specifically on government-endorsed networks could emerge, similar to how funds reorient around policy shifts in other sectors.
This shift extends beyond where capital flows and influences what types of projects are funded. Compliance-focused startups, infrastructure plays and enterprise-ready applications will attract more attention than purely speculative projects. VCs will increasingly favor teams that understand how to navigate the intersection of innovation and regulation.
For startups, this creates both opportunity and challenge. Building on these endorsed networks offers a more straightforward path to funding, but expectations around compliance and security will rise accordingly. The days of raising millions on concepts alone are giving way to the demand for solid execution and regulatory awareness.
With multiple chains now part of the strategic reserve, interoperability solutions take center stage. Projects enabling seamless movement between Ethereum, Solana and Cardano stand to benefit tremendously from this new multichain reality.
Crosschain bridges like Wormhole, initially connecting Ethereum and Solana, will likely expand to include Cardano as the demand for connectivity between all endorsed networks grows.
Protocols facilitating crosschain governance or identity will similarly find increased relevance as assets and users flow between networks.
The government’s endorsement of multiple chains effectively validates the multichain thesis — that different networks serve different use cases rather than one blockchain dominating all activity. This creates space for infrastructure that connects these specialized systems into a cohesive whole.
The effects of this government endorsement will unfold over multiple time horizons — the immediate price rallies and attention spikes we’ve already witnessed. The more substantial ecosystem growth will develop over months and years.
Expect new project announcements and funding rounds in the next three to six months, explicitly citing the strategic reserve to validate their approach. Development activity on these networks will accelerate as previously hesitant teams about regulatory risk jump in.
Within a year, we’ll likely see the first major institutional products built on these networks launch with formal regulatory approval. The venture funding deployed now will begin producing tangible applications across DeFi, identity, gaming and enterprise sectors.
By the two-to-three-year mark, if historical patterns from other government-validated technologies hold, these blockchain ecosystems could become mainstream infrastructure, extending far beyond their current use cases. As the internet grew from a government project to a commercial ecosystem, these networks could evolve from reserve assets to fundamental digital infrastructure.
The strategic reserve announcement might begin a new phase of worldwide blockchain adoption for investors, developers and users.

f7e63717003ecd0443095326d814c17a,Cointelegraph,"Deutsche Boerse to launch Bitcoin, Ether institutional custody: Report",https://cointelegraph.com/news/deutsche-boerse-to-launch-btc-eth-services-to-institutions-report," Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream to offer crypto custody and settlement services for institutional clients, expanding its Bitcoin and Ether offerings in 2025. 
Deutsche Boerse’s trading unit, Clearstream, is preparing to launch cryptocurrency custody and settlement services for institutional clients in 2025 amid increasing demand for regulated digital asset infrastructure.
The German exchange group plans to offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) custody to its more than 2,500 institutional clients, with services expected to begin in April, according to a Bloomberg report on March 11.
Clearstream will provide these digital asset services through Crypto Finance AG, a Switzerland-based subsidiary in which Deutsche Boerse acquired a majority stake in 2021.
Deutsche Boerse’s trading unit also aims to launch support for other cryptocurrencies and diversified services such as staking, lending and brokerage capabilities.
“With this offering, we are creating a one-stop shop around custody, brokerage and settlement,” Jens Hachmeister, head of issuer services and new digital markets at Clearstream, told Bloomberg.
The move aligns with a growing institutional push toward regulated crypto services in Europe following the implementation of Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which went into full effect for crypto asset service providers on Dec. 30, 2024.
The institutional offering came nearly two months after Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody became Germany’s first crypto asset service provider to receive a full license under MiCA, Cointelegraph reported on Jan. 17.
Boerse Stuttgart’s license was part of the firm’s efforts to become a regulated infrastructure provider for banks, brokers and asset managers.

While MiCA is widely viewed as a positive step for global crypto regulation, some industry experts worry about potential regulatory overreach that could impact retail investors and drive crypto firms out of Europe.
While the regulation is a significant step toward a more mature industry, it also seeks to identify the “weak points of control” in the crypto space, which could mean more scrutiny for retail investors and the end-users of crypto platforms, according to Dmitrij Radin, the founder of Zekret and chief technology officer of Fideum, a regulatory and blockchain infrastructure firm focused on institutions.
“Retail users will be way more obligated to provide information, data which will be screened. They will be accounted for. Most Europeans will see taxation,” Radin told Cointelegraph.

The regulation also raises the possibility of enforcement actions against blockchain protocols that fail to comply with MiCA standards. European governments may pursue legal cases against noncompliant platforms during the early implementation phase.
Other blockchain regulatory experts fear that MiCA will introduce consolidation among crypto firms with limited capital, leading to a potential crypto firm exodus to the Middle East due to more lenient regulations.

This dramatic shift set the foundation for Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve. 

 One of Trump’s headline proposals is creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the US, treating Bitcoin as a national reserve asset akin to digital gold. The plan centers on stockpiling Bitcoin seized in criminal cases rather than purchasing it with taxpayer funds.Key componentsBitcoin as a reserve asset: The US government would officially recognize Bitcoin as a strategic holding, similar to gold in Fort Knox, leveraging its fixed supply and decentralized nature.Seized crypto, not taxpayer purchases: Instead of selling confiscated Bitcoin at auction (as has been past practice), the government would retain it in a central reserve account. Trump’s executive order explicitly states that any Bitcoin deposited “shall not be sold.”No immediate buying spree: The plan does not include direct federal purchases of BTC but allows for “budget-neutral” methods to expand reserves, such as using proceeds from other seized assets.Does the US already have a Bitcoin stockpile? Yes, indirectly. Over the past decade, agencies have seized large amounts of BTC but historically auctioned it off rather than holding it. Trump’s policy would change that, aiming to preserve Bitcoin as a national asset.Supporters believe this could strengthen US finances and ensure the nation isn’t left behind in a Bitcoin-driven global economy. However, critics warn of Bitcoin’s volatility and the risks of integrating a decentralized asset into government reserves.

Here are the commonalities and differences between the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile:

 Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plan builds on a history of US government interactions with cryptocurrency, primarily through law enforcement and asset seizures.Seizures and auctions (Silk Road era)The government’s relationship with Bitcoin began in 2013–2014 with the Silk Road takedown, where federal agents seized 144,000 BTC — one of the largest Bitcoin hauls ever. Rather than holding the coins, the US Marshals Service auctioned them off, setting a precedent for liquidating seized crypto. Did you know? In 2014, venture capitalist Tim Draper bought 30,000 BTC for $18 million, a fraction of its later value.Accumulating and selling crypto holdingsSince then, US agencies have continued seizing and auctioning Bitcoin from various cases, selling nearly 200,000 BTC between 2014 and early 2023, netting around $366 million. However, with Bitcoin’s price surge, those sold coins would now be worth over $18 billion — raising questions about whether the government should have held onto them. Crypto advocates argue this history justifies a hodl policy rather than continued liquidation.Past administration policiesObama administration: Focused on regulating exchanges and curbing illicit use.Trump’s first term: Emphasized enforcement, sanctioning crypto accounts linked to adversaries and targeting tax evaders.Biden administration: Prioritized investor protection and regulatory enforcement, pursuing lawsuits against major exchanges in 2023 and continuing liquidation of seized Bitcoin rather than holding it.The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve was largely absent from previous administrations — until Trump’s 2024 proposal.Global contextOther governments, including China and Germany, have seized Bitcoin, but most — like the US — chose to auction it rather than stockpile it. No major economy has yet integrated Bitcoin into its sovereign reserves. The closest example is El Salvador, which made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 and began accumulating it. If fully implemented, Trump’s Bitcoin reserve strategy would make the US the first major nation to officially hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset, a significant shift in global crypto policy.Did you know? ​In 2024, Bhutan’s sovereign investment arm quietly amassed $750 million in Bitcoin holdings through hydroelectric-powered mining, amounting to 28% of the country’s gross domestic product.

 If the US establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the implications could be significant for markets, regulation and financial strategy.Market dynamicsA no-sell policy would remove key selling pressure, as seized Bitcoin would no longer be auctioned off, effectively reducing circulating supply. Some analysts see this as bullish for Bitcoin’s price. Anticipation of Trump’s pro-crypto stance already fueled market optimism in late 2024. However, political shifts could bring uncertainty — future administrations might reverse the policy and sell, making government-held Bitcoin a new market-moving factor.Legitimacy and mainstreamingIf the US holds Bitcoin as a strategic asset, it would mark the strongest government endorsement of crypto to date. This could encourage institutional investors and pressure other nations to consider similar policies. If multiple governments start stockpiling Bitcoin, it could integrate crypto more deeply into global finance, potentially affecting reserve diversification and even international sanctions.Regulatory shiftA national Bitcoin reserve aligns with a broader pro-crypto shift in US regulation. Trump has already signaled a friendlier stance, calling for clearer rules and protecting crypto firms’ banking access. This could reverse past regulatory hostility, making the US a more attractive hub for blockchain businesses.With the government holding Bitcoin, it may also incentivize policies that promote crypto growth, though balancing innovation and consumer protection remains a challenge.Did you know? ​In 2025, President Trump appointed David Sacks as the White House AI and crypto czar to establish a legal framework for the cryptocurrency industry.Financial strategy and the dollarTrump insists Bitcoin won’t replace the US dollar, but holding it as a reserve asset could complement rather than compete with the dollar — similar to gold. If Bitcoin appreciates, it could strengthen US financial standing, but if it gains too much influence in global reserves, it might challenge fiat dominance over time.While speculative for now, a national Bitcoin reserve could reshape the role of digital assets in global finance.

Gox moved a batch of Bitcoin worth over $930 million on March 11 as the bankrupt crypto exchange vies to fully repay customers by Oct. 31. 
Defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox moved almost a billion worth of Bitcoin, the second large BTC transfer in a week, as Bitcoin’s price fell to a four-month low on March 11.
Of the 11,833 Bitcoin (BTC) moved, 11,501 ($905.1 million) were sent into a new wallet, while the remaining 332 Bitcoin ($26.1 million) were transferred to a warm wallet, according to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, citing Arkham Intelligence data. 
The transfer cost Mt. Gox just $2.13.

It comes less than a week after Mt. Gox moved 12,000 Bitcoin worth a little over $1 billion on March 6. Arkham noted that $15 million of those funds were sent to BitGo — one of the custodians facilitating Mt. Gox’s creditor repayments.
Blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain said the 332 Bitcoin that recently went into the warm wallet may also be moved to assist with the repayments.
The movement coincided with a 2.4% price fall for Bitcoin to $76,784 over 30 minutes, CoinGecko data shows, retreating to November prices when the market was rallying on the back of US President Donald Trump’s election win.
While Bitcoin recovered from the slump to $79,275 soon after, Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes advised investors to “be fucking patient” in a March 11 X post in which he predicted Bitcoin would bottom around the $70,000 mark.

The Trump administration may be intentionally creating uncertainty in the stock markets to corner Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell into lowering interest rates, according to a market commentator. 
Doing so increases the likelihood that the US won’t need to refinance around $7 trillion in debt it owes over the next few months, Bitcoin commentator Anthony Pompliano said in a March 10 X post.
US President Donald Trump and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent are “taking matters into their own hands; they’re crashing asset prices in an attempt to force Jerome Powell to cut interest rates,” said Pompliano, who serves as the founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management and host of The Pomp Podcast.

In late January, Powell announced the Fed was not lowering interest rates from the current target range of 4.25% to 4.5% despite calls from Trump to do so.
Pompliano said the recent market panic has been driven in part by Trump’s tariffs — and has been used to create a more favorable bond market while lowering the 10-year Treasury yield.
He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield is already down from nearly 4.8% in January to 4.21% now — a sign that Trump’s purported strategy is “heading in the right direction.”

Whether Pompliano’s theory is correct or not, the stock market has been tanking of late, and crypto has been hit even harder.
Broad market index funds such as State Street’s Standard & Poor’s 500 index fund (SPY) fell 2.66% on March 10 alone, while the Nasdaq-100% fell 3.8%, Google Finance data shows.
Both indexes are down 7.32% and 10.7% over the last month, while Bitcoin (BTC) is down 27.4% from its $108,786 all-time high, and over $1.2 trillion has been wiped from the cryptocurrency market cap since Dec. 17. 
If the stock market continues to tank, it will come down to a “who blinks first” contest between Trump and Powell, Pompliano said.
While Trump hasn’t confirmed such a strategy, Pompliano pointed to a Fox News interview on March 9 where Trump said: “Nobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high because people can’t borrow money.”
Pompliano added that lowering interest rates would also benefit American consumers:

CME FedWatch, a tool used to measure expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate change, has tipped a 96% probability that the target rate will remain between 4.25% and 4.50% following the Federal Reserve’s next meeting on March 19. 
However, it’s near 50-50 odds for the target rate to be lowered in the Federal Reserve’s following meeting on May 7.
The Federal Reserve typically avoids lowering interest rates when inflation is high, as one of its primary objectives is to maintain price stability.
However, a Trump-inflicted recession, or “Trumpcession,” as some call it, could force America’s top bank to start cutting again.

fc2145323cb61260e4baa66cc78d72d8,Cointelegraph,"California financial regulator warns of 7 new types of crypto, AI scams",https://cointelegraph.com/news/californian-regulator-warns-7-new-crypto-ai-scams," California’s Department of Justice says it took down 42 crypto scam websites in 2024 that haad stolen $6.5 million from users. 
A California financial regulator says users reported seven new types of crypto and AI scams that it hadn’t seen before through thousands of complaints in 2024. 
The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) said in a March 10 statement that it received 2,668 complaints in 2024 and found seven types of scams they didn’t have on record yet, such as fake Bitcoin (BTC) mining schemes, where fraudsters offer fake investments in mining. 
The DFPI also received complaints about fake crypto gaming schemes, where users are encouraged to deposit funds only to have their wallets drained, and fraudsters offering fake jobs that require victims to transfer crypto and provide private information.

Victims also reported the theft of private keys through fake airdrops, fake investment group scams in WhatsApp or Telegram, AI Investment scams offering unusually high returns and losing their crypto after interacting with certain sham websites. 
The AI industry experienced significant growth in 2024, reaching a market cap of $638 billion, according to Precedence Research. 
There was also a notable rise in crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS), where experienced hackers and cybercriminals sell their tools and services to less experienced offenders for a price.
DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni said the regulator is urging caution when interacting with unknown platforms and to “verify website domains to avoid fraudulent imitations, and stay wary of crypto recovery scam sites.”
Through its partnership with the State, the DFPI says it shut down more than 26 fraudulent crypto websites and uncovered $4.6 million in user losses last year. 
California’s Department of Justice (DOJ) took down 42 crypto scam websites in 2024 that stole $6.5 million from victims, with an average loss per person of $146,306.
In a March 10 statement, the California DOJ said that because international fraudsters often carry out scams, they are difficult to prosecute and arrest.
Common threads among the scam websites were promises of high returns, no contact information, offers of prizes for signing up, and no listings on legitimate crypto industry websites such as CoinMarketCap, the California DOJ said.

A report from on-chain security firm Cyvers identified pig butchering schemes as one of the most costly in 2024, estimating the scam cost the industry over $5.5 billion across 200,000 identified cases. 
Meanwhile, blockchain security firm CertiK’s annual Web3 security report flagged crypto phishing attacks, which cost users $1 billion across 296 incidents, as the most significant security threat of 2024.

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

3271329d1e6b2ee41a54e55a029001bf,Cointelegraph,Here’s why chasing trends can be a costly mistake: X Spaces with VCs,https://cointelegraph.com/news/heres-why-chasing-trends-can-be-a-costly-mistake-x-spaces-with-vcs," DePIN, decentralized AI, the shift from EVM blockchains and regulatory changes under the new US administration are key trends to follow in 2025. And venture capitalists already took a position. 

Restructuring business models in traditional organizations, AI is increasingly adopted in Web3 as well, with new integrations announced each day. Is this a lasting trend that will provide value and opportunities for years to come, or just another passing hype?
Cointelegraph Accelerator recently hosted a roundtable discussion on X Spaces, bringing together venture capitalists to find an answer. Nikola Santoni, partner at Lemniscap; Ivan Li, founding partner at Comma3 Ventures and Michael Zajko, co-founder of Lattice, shared insights on the current state of the crypto investments, key trends and factors that will shape the landscape in 2025.
🔥 Missed our Web3 & crypto AMA? Here’s the TL|DR:✅ Top industry verticals for 2025✅ Most promising startups to watch✅ Biggest barriers to mass adoption🎙️ Catch the recap our X Spaces w/ @comma3vc, @Lemniscap & @MikeZajko🔗 Listen now: https://t.co/qNHr1rvNiD
Nikola Santoni began by emphasizing the importance of assessing future demand rather than chasing current trends. “Obviously, the intersection of crypto and AI, with AI agents, has accelerated tremendously, which is impossible to ignore. But what stands out is how quickly the narratives and attention spans are changing, from retail investors to the media to institutional investors. This is what we need to be aware of when investing.”
Shedding light on Lemniscap’s approach, Santoni said the company focuses on identifying natural market demand and teams with potential for product development. “We tend to build conviction very early on. A key consideration is whether the product you originally envisioned makes sense in the long run,” he stated.
Agreeing on the point, Michael Zajko said, “To be successful, you need to invest before something becomes a hot trend, not after.” He noted that venture investments typically have a 5-7-year timeline and pointed to some examples like DeFi Summer, where investing at the peak would have meant missing out on earlier opportunities like Uniswap and Aave.
""We are investing in something that may not be available for several years. This trend has played out year after year with DeFi, NFTs, gaming and now decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). We have been big proponents of DePIN, and there are many exciting projects,” Zajko explained, continuing: “But the path to market and token launch for a really high-quality project is much longer because they’re using real-world infrastructure. Some of the DePIN tokens are coming to market this year, and there’s going to be a lot of exciting opportunities in that space.”
Ivan Li echoed the same sentiment, saying, “It’s risky to chase all the chains. If you’re a trader in the open market, you can chase these narrative changes in the short term because there’s a lot of liquidity. But in primary investments, there is no liquidity, so it is a very risky game. The long timelines - three years to TGE and another year for lock-ups and vesting - only add to the risk. The key is to invest before a project gets off the ground.”
Li said Comma3 Ventures doesn’t see a bright future for EVM-based blockchains and keeps the focus on somewhere else. “I suggest everyone take a closer look at Move-based blockchains like SUI. If you compare SUI to EVM, it’s like today’s Tesla to Ferrari 30 years ago. Our portfolio at Comma3 Ventures currently covers about 85-90% of the total value locked up in the entire SUI ecosystem.”
Zajko mentioned that the excitement around AI is largely due to its rapid development within Web2, but most AI-related projects in crypto today take a simplistic approach. “It’s a good way to speculate, and frankly, there’s still a very strong product-market fit in crypto for anything you can speculate on,” he said.
“What stands out to me is that developers are taking a more cautious approach. I think they’re looking at what actually works and delivers long-term value rather than just launching a token for retail speculation. A lot of these projects won’t come out right away, but I do expect to see more advanced AI agents this year that do things that aren’t just tweeting,” Zajko added.
According to the co-founder, AI can be divided into two main areas: “Enterprise AI includes decentralized compute projects like io.net and Render Network. Then you have the more retail-focused projects that are still in development. And there are a number of more platform-oriented projects that haven’t launched tokens on the enterprise side, like Ritual or Sentient. So I would expect to see a reemergence of that category. They’re coming out in the second half of the year, and their tokens should bring new energy to decentralized AI.”
Li emphasized the double-edged nature of regulation, saying, “Without a clear legal framework, there will be issues with AML, taxes and even the ability to take innovative risks within a proper structure, which is a huge risk for founders and investors. On the other hand, regulation also opens the door to institutional capital, even from conservative sources such as pension funds.”
For Li, regulation is also a matter of global competition: ""It's a kind of game theory between countries. If the US regulates crypto and collects taxes, but the rules are too restrictive, people will move and innovate elsewhere. We could have problems with entrepreneurs leaving, and that's something to consider.""
Zajko sees positive changes in the industry, especially with a more crypto-friendly approach from the new U.S. administration: ""With the new administration and new members of the SEC, and with enforcement actions like those against OpenSea and Coinbase being dropped, teams are starting to go back to the tactics and strategies they've always wanted to use, ones that are really beneficial to the space — like token sales, which are what made crypto. And teams are going back to them and selling to retail participants at attractive entry prices.""
He highlighted the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, saying, ""You're already seeing government reserves and government treasuries being proposed to deposit in Bitcoin. The people who are making these decisions right now tend to be from an older generation. It's not so much that they need to be convinced; it's just that over time, they will pass out of power and younger people who are already comfortable with digital assets will take over. Whether the current leadership eventually embraces digital assets or simply transitions out of their roles, the outcome seems inevitable.""
""It's just a matter of when, not if,"" Zajko concluded.

02d5481bce5fc5472818919ca2347103,Cointelegraph,"Price analysis 3/10: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, PI",https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-analysis-3-10-spx-dxy-btc-eth-xrp-bnb-sol-doge-ada-pi," Bitcoin risks a fall below the critical $78,258 support, opening the doors for a further fall to $73,777. 
Bitcoin (BTC) bulls tried to push the price above $85,000, but the bears held their ground. A minor positive is that larger investors seem to be accumulating at lower levels. 
Research firm Santiment said in a post on X that wallets with 10 BTC or more have bought roughly 5,000 Bitcoin since March 3. The researchers added that if buying by the large players continues, the second half of March could be much better than the recent performance of Bitcoin.
However, not everyone is bullish on Bitcoin in the near term. BitMEX co-founder and Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes said in a post on X that Bitcoin could retest $78,000 and even below $75,000. 
He added that Bitcoin’s price action could become violent if it drops in the $70,000 to $75,000 zone as a lot of Bitcoin open interest is stuck in that range.

Meanwhile, short-term investor sentiment remains bearish. According to CoinShares data, cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) witnessed $876 million in outflows last week, taking the four-week total outflows to $4.75 billion. Bitcoin ETPs recorded the lion’s share of outflows at $756 million.
Can Bitcoin start a recovery from the current levels, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts to find out.
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) turned down from the 20-day exponential moving average (5,900) on March 3 and broke below the 5,773 support on March 6, completing a double-top pattern.

The index bounced off the 5,670 level on March 7, but the bears successfully defended the breakdown level of 5,773. The index turned down and broke below the 5,670 support on March 10, opening the doors for a fall to 5,400.
Buyers will have to push and sustain the price above 5,773 to suggest solid demand at lower levels. The index could then rise to the 20-day EMA, which is again expected to act as a strong resistance. 
The US Dollar Index (DXY) turned down sharply on March 3 and continued lower, breaking below the 105.42 support on March 5.
DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The fall below 105.42 suggests that the breakout above 108 may have been a bull trap. Buyers are trying to defend the 103.73 level, but the relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA (106.03). 
If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a negative sentiment. That increases the risk of a break below 103.37. If that happens, the index may plunge to 101.
Buyers have an uphill task ahead of them. They will have to push and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA to clear the path for a rally to 108.
BTC price broke below the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on March 9, indicating that the sellers have overpowered the buyers.
BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The bulls are trying to defend the $81,500 to $78,258 support zone, but the recovery attempt faced selling at the breakdown level on March 10. That suggests the bears are trying to flip the support line into resistance. If the price skids below $78,258, the BTC/USDT pair could collapse to $73,777.
Buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to defend the support zone and push the price above the 20-day EMA ($88,605). If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to the resistance line.
Ether (ETH) fell and closed below the vital $2,111 support on March 9, signaling the start of the next leg of the downtrend.
ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Buyers tried to push the price above $2,111 on March 10, but the long wick on the candlestick suggests solid selling by the bears. There is minor support at $1,993, but if the level cracks, the ETH/USDT pair could sink to $1,750 and eventually to $1,550.

The bulls will have to push and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,329) to signal that the break below $2,111 may have been a bear trap. The pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA ($2,711).
XRP (XRP) continues to slide toward the crucial support at $2, suggesting that the bears are trying to seize control.
XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
A break and close below $2 will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. There is minor support at $1.77, but the level is likely to be broken. If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair could plunge toward $1.28.
Related: Is XRP price going to crash again?
Contrary to this assumption, a solid bounce off $2 will signal that the bulls are vigorously defending this level. The 20-day EMA ($2.40) is likely to act as a stiff hurdle, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could reach $2.80.
BNB’s (BNB) failure to rise above the 20-day EMA ($601) attracted another round of selling on March 9, pulling the price below $546.
BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The down-sloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the price maintains below $546, the BNB/USDT pair could plummet to $500. Buyers are expected to aggressively defend the zone between $500 and $460.
The 20-day EMA is the first significant resistance to watch out for on the upside. If this level gets taken out, the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($633). A close above the 50-day SMA signals a short-term trend change.
Solana (SOL) broke below the uptrend line on March 9 and reached the strong support zone between $120 and $110.
SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The bulls are expected to fiercely defend the support zone, but the relief rally could face selling at the 20-day EMA ($150). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the $110 level will be at risk of breaking down. If that happens, the SOL/USDT pair could decline to $100 and later to $80.
Instead, if the price rises from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest solid buying near the support zone. The pair could then climb to the 50-day SMA ($188).
Dogecoin (DOGE) fell below the $0.18 support on March 9, indicating the resumption of the downtrend.
DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The down-sloping moving averages and the RSI in the oversold territory suggest that bears have the upper hand. The 20-day EMA ($0.21) is the critical overhead resistance to watch out for. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the DOGE/USDT pair could sink to $0.14.
Alternatively, a break and close above the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($0.26), which may also act as a stiff resistance.
Cardano (ADA) fell below the moving averages on March 8, indicating aggressive selling by the bears.
ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Both moving averages have started to turn down, and the RSI has slipped into negative territory, indicating that the bears have a slight edge. The support on the downside is at $0.58 and then $0.50.
Any relief rally is likely to face selling at the moving averages. Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above the moving averages to signal a comeback. The ADA/USDT pair could then rise toward $1.02.
Pi (PI) fell to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $1.20 on March 9, indicating that the bears have kept up the pressure.
PI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Buyers are trying to start a recovery, but the long wick on the March 10 candlestick shows selling at higher levels. That increases the risk of a break below $1.20. If that happens, the PI/USDT pair could plunge to the 78.6% retracement level of $0.72.
Time is running out for the bulls. To prevent more downside, they will have to quickly push the price above the $2 overhead resistance. If they do that, it will suggest that the correction may be over.
