925f1c7123fc3565809962e7230de40c,Cointelegraph,US court fines UAE crypto firm CLS Global $428K for wash trading,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-court-fines-cls-global-428000-wash-trading," CLS Global is one of the “victims” of the FBI’s trap token NexFundAI, alongside Hong Kong-linked ZM Quant Investment and Russia-linked Gotbit Consulting. 
Authorities in the US state of Massachusetts continue targeting unlawful cryptocurrency market practices, with a local court fining crypto financial services firm CLS Global.
A federal court in Boston on April 2 sentenced CLS Global on criminal charges related to fraudulent manipulation of crypto trading volume, according to an announcement from the Massachusetts US Attorney’s Office.
In addition to a $428,059 fine, the court prohibited CLS Global from offering services in the US for a probation period of three years.
CLS Global, a crypto market maker registered in the United Arab Emirates, in January pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit market manipulation and one count of wire fraud.
The charges against CLS Global followed an undercover law enforcement operation involving NexFundAI, a token created by the FBI as part of a sting operation in May 2024.
CLS Global was among at least three firms that took the FBI’s bait and agreed to provide “market maker services” for NexFundAI, including a fraudulent scheme to attract investors to purchase the token.
In October 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced fraud charges against CLS and its employee, Andrey Zhorzhes. The US securities regulator also filed complaints against two other NexFundAI manipulators, Hong Kong-linked ZM Quant Investment and Russia-linked Gotbit Consulting.
According to CLS Global CEO Filipp Veselov, the company was founded in 2017 to fill in a “huge gap in the market for high-quality market-making solutions and trading consulting.”
Prior to CLS, Veselov worked at the Russian cryptocurrency exchange platform Latoken, which is advertised as a “global digital asset exchange” and has about 370,000 followers on X.
The CLS team also includes chief revenue officer Pavel Singaevskii, who previously served as sales manager at Stex, a crypto platform that reportedly ceased operations without warning in 2023.

According to CLS Global’s X page, the platform continues operating and has more than 110,000 followers at the time of publication.
Wash trading is an illegal practice involving artificially inflating trading volume by repeatedly buying and selling the same asset, generating a misleading perception of demand.
According to a January 2025 report by the US blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the crypto market has at least $2.6 billion in estimated wash traded volumes, or just about 2% of total daily crypto trading volumes, as reported by CoinGecko.

Some studies indicate that wash trading makes up a bigger share of the crypto market.
In 2022, the US National Bureau of Economic Research reported that illegal wash trading may account for as much as 70% of average trading volumes on unregulated exchanges.

2e146482a6eadc0e3d9e7d62aa7a43bf,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin DeFi surge may boost BTC demand and adoption — Binance,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-demand-skyrocket-2-700-bitcoin-defi-surge," The growing BTCFi sector and potential interest rate cuts on the horizon may create more demand for Bitcoin as a productive, yield-bearing asset. 
The value locked in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (BTCFi) has surged by more than 2,700% over the past year, potentially transforming Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a productive, yield-bearing asset, according to new research from Binance.
BTCFi is a new technological paradigm that aims to bring decentralized finance capabilities to Bitcoin’s base layer. It is one of the fastest-growing crypto sectors, reaching a total value locked (TVL) of over $8.6 billion.
The growing value of BTCFi, “along with potential interest rate cuts, may reinforce positive sentiment for Bitcoin in the medium and long term,” Binance Research wrote in a report shared with Cointelegraph.

If the BTCFi sector’s growth trajectory continues, it could open up “new opportunities for Bitcoin holders to generate yield through lending, liquidity provision, and other DeFi mechanisms,” a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding:

Interest in BTCFi surged after April 2024’s Bitcoin halving, which introduced the Runes protocol, the first fungible token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Several Bitcoin-native projects have helped accelerate the trend. 
Babylon introduced Bitcoin (BTC) staking for the first time in the network’s history, enabling holders to earn passive income from their assets.
Hermetica launched the first Bitcoin-backed synthetic dollar, USDh, which debuted with a 25% yield for investors.

Long-term holders are wallets that have been holding BTC for at least 155 days. Growing accumulation from long-term holders has reduced the available Bitcoin supply on exchanges, which may eventually lead to a supply shock-driven price rally.
The growing accumulation trend among long-term holders aligns with a “significant period of adoption for Bitcoin,” due to the establishment of the US strategic Bitcoin reserve and growing institutional interest, according to the research report.

On March 7, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve using BTC seized from government criminal cases.
Trump signed the historic Bitcoin reserve order a day ahead of hosting the first White House Crypto Summit, which received mixed reactions from the crypto community.

fcd1faa605205566dd6a2290ce45d167,Cointelegraph,How to sell crypto via MetaMask: A beginner’s guide to cashing out,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-sell-crypto-via-meta-mask," To sell crypto via your MetaMask wallet, you need to be aware of swapping, bridging and using fiat off-ramps to convert your crypto into fiat. 
Not all tokens can be sold immediately. Airdropped or obscure tokens may lack liquidity or could be scams, so it’s important to check before attempting to cash out.
Swapping and bridging may be required. To sell, you might need to convert tokens to ETH or stablecoins and bridge them to the Ethereum mainnet.
MetaMask integrates fiat off-ramps. You can use the MetaMask Portfolio to sell ETH directly, but be prepared for KYC with third-party providers.
Non-KYC and P2P options exist. Platforms like Bisq or LocalCoinSwap allow trading without ID, but they carry more risk and require caution.
There are plenty of ways you might end up with a mix of different cryptocurrencies sitting in your MetaMask wallet.
Maybe you work in Web3 — as a developer, copywriter or designer — and your client paid you in their project’s native token.
Or maybe you’re part of a Bitcoin mining pool and occasionally receive rewards straight to your wallet.
You could be farming yield in decentralized finance (DeFi), earning annual percentage yield (APY) on your locked assets. Or, perhaps the most straightforward of all: You completed a few SocialFi tasks and received some community tokens via an airdrop.
Whatever the case, you’ve got crypto in your MetaMask — and now you want to turn it into cash.
In this guide, you’ll learn all the ways you can sell your crypto and withdraw the funds to your bank account or even in cash — whether you’re going through official Know Your Customer (KYC) channels or sticking to more private, non-KYC routes.
Before you can turn your tokens into cash, there are a few things you need to get sorted in MetaMask because “not all tokens are created equal.” It’s not always as simple as hitting a “sell” button — especially if you’ve just received tokens via an airdrop or from a lesser-known project.
Just because a token shows up in your wallet doesn’t mean it’s ready to be sold. In fact, many airdropped tokens aren’t listed on exchanges at all. That means there’s no market where you can sell them — not yet, anyway. You might see a price attached to the token, but without buyers or liquidity, that value isn’t something you can actually realize right now. So, while it’s great to receive free tokens, they may end up sitting idle in your wallet for a while.
Did you know? If you see a “100% sell fee detected” warning on a token, it’s likely a scam. Scammers airdrop these tokens, hoping you’ll try to sell or interact with them. But when you do, the smart contract takes the full amount — leaving you with nothing. Worse, some link to fake decentralized applications (DApps) that ask you to “claim” or “unlock” the tokens. Connecting your wallet or signing a transaction there can let scammers drain your real assets.
Sometimes, you’ll receive tokens that don’t even show up in MetaMask at first. That doesn’t mean they’re not there — it just means MetaMask doesn’t recognize them by default. You’ll need to add them manually by grabbing the token’s contract address (usually from the project’s official site or Etherscan) and importing it into your wallet. Once you do that, your balance will show up properly.
Similarly, if you want to receive any asset other than Ether (ETH), the “Import Tokens” option lets you manually add these missing tokens so they show up in the assets list.
Even if your tokens are visible in MetaMask and technically have value, that doesn’t always mean you can sell them for cash right away. Many smaller or newer tokens don’t have direct fiat trading pairs — so you won’t be able to exchange them straight into dollars or euros. 
To get around this, you’ll usually need to swap them for something more liquid, like ETH or a stablecoin such as USDC (USDC), which are more commonly supported by fiat off-ramps.
In some cases, your tokens might also be sitting on a different blockchain — like Arbitrum, BNB Chain or Polygon — while most fiat withdrawal options only support Ethereum mainnet. When that’s the case, you’ll need to bridge your tokens over to Ethereum before you can sell them.
One way to handle both of these steps — swapping and bridging — is by using platforms that combine them into a single flow. For example, with Symbiosis.finance, you can swap a token on one chain and receive a more widely accepted token on Ethereum, all in one transaction. This can save you a few steps and reduce the chance of user error when hopping between tools.
The simplest way to sell crypto that you hold on MetaMask is by using the application itself. Here’s what to do:
Open MetaMask portfolio: In your MetaMask extension or app, click the “Buy & Sell” button. This will take you to the MetaMask Portfolio site, where you can manage all your assets and begin the selling process.
Start the sale process: Click on “Move crypto” at the top of the page and select “Sell” from the dropdown options.
Choose your region and currency: MetaMask will ask for your country of residence and preferred fiat currency. This step ensures you’re shown accurate provider options and payout methods available in your area.
Enter sale amount: Select Ether and enter how much you’d like to convert.
Pick a payout option: Next, choose where you want the fiat to go. Depending on your region and provider availability, you might be able to send it to a bank account, PayPal or another method.
Compare offers: MetaMask aggregates offers from several third-party providers (like MoonPay, Transak, Sardine, etc.), showing you real-time exchange rates, fees and estimated payout times. Take a moment to compare and pick the best option for you.
Complete the sale: Once you’ve chosen a provider, MetaMask will guide you through sending the crypto. You’ll confirm the transaction in your wallet, and the funds will be transferred to the provider, who handles the fiat payout.
There are two things to keep in mind when using the MetaMask application:
Firstly, while the application itself might not ask you for KYC, the third-party providers will. So, expect to get your documents ready for this one.
Secondly, MetaMask’s sell feature only supports ETH on the Ethereum mainnet. This is where the bridging will come in as was explained earlier.
If you’d rather cash out your crypto through a centralized exchange, Coinbase is a popular option. It’s beginner-friendly, offers fiat withdrawals, and supports a wide range of assets. Just note: You’ll need to complete KYC verification before withdrawing any fiat.
Here’s how to do it, step by step:
First things first: You’ll need to move your funds from MetaMask to Coinbase.
Log in to your Coinbase account and hit “Send & Receive” at the top.
Switch to the “Receive” tab, pick the crypto you’re sending (like ETH or USDC), and copy the wallet address Coinbase gives you.
Make sure the network matches — for example, if you’re sending ETH, it should be on the Ethereum (ERC-20) network.
Now open MetaMask:
Click “Send,” paste in that Coinbase address, and enter how much you want to transfer.
Double-check the network — if you send it to the wrong one, your funds could disappear.
Hit “Confirm,” and your crypto should show up in Coinbase after a few minutes.
Once your funds land in Coinbase, it’s time to cash out.
Head to “Buy & Sell” at the top and switch to the “Sell” tab.
Choose the crypto you just received and decide how much you want to sell.
Pick where you want the money to go — like your linked bank account, PayPal or your Coinbase balance.
Review the details (including any fees), then hit “Sell.”
Did you know? When withdrawing via centralized exchanges, be cautious of minimum withdrawal amounts and any associated fees. Check these details in advance to make sure the limits and costs are acceptable to you before committing to this route.
With peer-to-peer (P2P), you’re not selling your crypto to the exchange. Instead, you’re selling it to another user. You choose a buyer based on their offer and preferred payment method (like bank transfer, Revolut, Wise, etc.). Once they send the money to your account, you release the crypto to them. The platform holds your crypto in escrow during the process, so no one can just disappear with your funds.
With centralized exchanges, you’ll have to complete KYC before you’re able to trade in this manner. 
Go to Trade > P2P.
Choose the coin you want to sell and browse the list of available buyers.
Select a deal, confirm the order, and wait for the buyer to make the payment.
Once the payment has arrived in your account, confirm it and release the crypto from escrow.
Did you know? Some peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchanges offer a “cash by mail” option, allowing users to send physical cash through postal services or couriers to settle transactions.
For those looking to convert cryptocurrency from their MetaMask wallet to fiat currency without undergoing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, there are still a few viable paths.
Decentralized P2P platforms let you trade directly with other users, much like their centralized counterparts, though often with minimal or no KYC requirements. 
LocalCoinSwap: A non-custodial P2P marketplace that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and payment methods, including cash. It offers escrow protection and emphasizes privacy.
Bisq: A fully decentralized exchange that supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Monero (XMR). It runs on a peer-to-peer protocol and doesn’t require user accounts or KYC.
However, without KYC, you’re responsible for vetting the person you’re trading with. Check their reputation, review any available trade history, and always follow platform safety guidelines.
Withdrawing funds from your MetaMask wallet using cryptocurrency ATMs — often referred to as Bitcoin ATMs — is an option that allows you to convert your digital assets into cash. Here’s how you can approach this method:
Locate a cryptocurrency ATM: Begin by finding a cryptocurrency ATM in your vicinity. Websites like CoinATMRadar provide directories of Bitcoin ATM locations worldwide, detailing the services they offer and the cryptocurrencies they support.
Prepare your MetaMask wallet: Ensure that the cryptocurrency you intend to withdraw is supported by the ATM. Bitcoin ATMs predominantly support Bitcoin (BTC), so you may need to use a decentralized exchange (DEX) to swap your current tokens for BTC within your MetaMask wallet. Be mindful of transaction fees and exchange rates during this process.
Initiate the withdrawal process: At the ATM, select the option to withdraw cash. The machine will prompt you to specify the amount you wish to withdraw and provide a QR code representing the ATM’s wallet address.
Transfer funds from MetaMask: Using your MetaMask wallet, scan the QR code provided by the ATM to input the recipient address accurately. Enter the exact amount of cryptocurrency required and confirm the transaction. Be aware that network congestion can affect transaction times.
Collect your cash: Once the blockchain confirms the transaction, the ATM will dispense the equivalent amount in cash, minus any applicable fees. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to longer, depending on network conditions.
When using crypto ATMs, you should expect very high fees, and while small transactions don’t usually require KYC, larger ones still might.
Taxes aren’t the most exciting topic, but they matter when converting crypto from a MetaMask wallet into fiat. Selling crypto, whether through MetaMask, an exchange or a P2P deal, may trigger a taxable event, and understanding the applicable rules is essential.
In most countries, including the US, selling crypto for fiat (like US dollars, euros, etc.) is treated like selling property. That means if you bought ETH at $1,000 and sold it later for $1,500, you’ve made a $500 capital gain — and that’s usually taxable.
Even swapping one crypto for another (say, ETH for USDC) can trigger the same kind of tax obligation, even if no fiat is involved. So, yeah, it’s not just cashing out that counts — any trade can be reportable.
To stay on top of it, keep a record of:
When you bought and sold each asset
How much you bought and/or sold
What it was worth in fiat at the time
Any fees paid along the way.
These details make life way easier when tax season rolls around — or if your accountant gives you that look.
Crypto laws aren’t one-size-fits-all. Every country has its own stance, and even within the same country, rules can vary depending on how you’re using crypto.
In the US, for example, selling crypto could fall under capital gains tax rules or even money transmission laws, depending on how you’re moving the funds. Other countries might have more lenient — or much stricter — regulations.
So, here’s what to do:
Look up your local crypto tax laws (even if they seem vague or outdated).
Stay current — regulations are evolving fast.
Talk to a pro if you’re unsure. A crypto-savvy accountant or legal adviser can help you avoid nasty surprises.
Even if you’re using non-KYC methods or decentralized tools, tax authorities may still expect a full report. Being proactive about it will save you headaches later — and might even save you money.
Happy cashing out!

2930342e49179a5f6f3a7f445b809635,Cointelegraph,Babylon users unstake $21M in Bitcoin following token airdrop,https://cointelegraph.com/news/babylon-21-million-unstaked-baby-airdrop," Over $21 million in Bitcoin was unstaked from Babylon as early users claimed 600 million BABY tokens in the platform’s latest airdrop. 
More than $21 million worth of Bitcoin was unstaked from the Babylon protocol in the 24 hours after the platform’s token airdrop, according to blockchain data shared by a developer.
On April 4, Bitfeed developer Mononaut shared that in the previous 24 hours, 256 Bitcoin (BTC) had been unstaked from the staking protocol. Mononaut said that the unstaking transactions paid 1.35 BTC in fees and consumed 1.318 Megavirtualbytes (MvB) of blockspace. This means the transactions generated high fees and occupied roughly a third of an entire Bitcoin block. 
The activity followed Babylon’s 600 million airdrop of its native token, BABY, which was distributed to early users and contributors.

In a previous Cointelegraph interview, Babylon co-founder Fisher Yu said that, unlike Ethereum and Solana, Bitcoin staking does not reward stakers in the chain’s native asset. Instead, they may get rewards in the form of the native token of the blockchain secured by the staked Bitcoin capital. 
On April 3, the Babylon Foundation announced the details of the airdrop program for its early adopters. The protocol said the airdrop was dedicated to its Phase 1 stakers, non-fungible token (NFT) holders and developers contributing to its ecosystem. 
The staking protocol said it was airdropping 600 million BABY tokens, 6% of its total supply; 30 million BABY were allocated to the protocol’s Pioneer Pass NFT holders, while 5 million BABY were slated for open-source contributors. 
The rest of the tokens were to be distributed among eligible stakers who participated in the protocol’s Phase 1. This included a stake participation airdrop of 30 million BABY, a base staking reward airdrop of 335 million BABY and a bonus staking reward airdrop for Phase 2 transition of 200 million BABY.  
While the platform distributed an airdrop for its early adopters, it clarified that it did not include wallet campaigns and liquid staking incentives in this airdrop event. 
In response to the airdrop, crypto exchange OKX listed the BABY token and USDT pair in pre-market futures. Pre-market futures allow traders to speculate on an asset’s future price. This allows investors to trade BABY futures before the asset becomes available in spot markets.
Data platform DefiLlama shows that Babylon currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $4.29 billion. This represents 80% of the Bitcoin ecosystem’s overall TVL of $5.34 billion.

ec1ae19103b2dc74b4b1844b304a22a0,Cointelegraph,Arthur Hayes loves tariffs as printed money pain is good for Bitcoin,https://cointelegraph.com/news/arthur-hayes-donald-trump-tariffs-bitcoin-price-pump," Arthur Hayes says that tariffs will correct “global imbalances,” which will positively impact Bitcoin's price over the medium term. 
BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says US President Donald Trump's tariffs may rattle the global economy in some ways, but that same disruption could be exactly what Bitcoin needs to rally.
“Global imbalances will be corrected, and the pain papered over with printed money, which is good for BTC,” Hayes said in an April 3 X post.
“Some of y'all are running scurred, but I LOVE TARIFFS,” Hayes said. 
His comments come just a day after it was announced that the Trump administration will hit all countries with a 10% tariff starting April 5, with some countries facing even larger rates, such as China facing a 34% tariff, the European Union 20%, and Japan 24%. 
Hayes explained that tariffs positively impact Bitcoin's (BTC) price for several reasons.

One of them, he said, is the “weakening” of the US Dollar Index (DXY), as overseas investors continue to sell off US stocks and “bring money home.” 
April 3 marked “the largest single-day point loss for the Nasdaq 100 in history,” according to the trading resource account The Kobeissi Letter.
“The index lost a total of -1060 points and came just 1.5% away from triggering the first circuit breaker since March 2020,” The Kobeissi Letter said.
""This is good for BTC and gold over the medium term.""
Hayes also said that the stringent tariff placed on China may weaken the yuan (CNY). “With a 65% effective tariff levied, China could respond by allowing CNY to weaken past 8.00,” Hayes said. 
A weakening yuan may force the hand of Chinese investors to look at riskier assets such as Bitcoin to preserve their wealth.
Meanwhile, Hayes said that “we need Fed easing,” noting that the two-year Treasury yield “dumped” following the tariff announcement.

He explained this as a signal that markets expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates and potentially restart quantitative easing (QE) to offset the negative economic impact.

Meanwhile, Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, has long argued that Trump's tariffs will ultimately benefit Bitcoin.
He said on Feb. 3 that in a “world of weaker dollar and weaker US rates…risk assets in the US will fly through the roof beyond your wildest imagination.”
“Bookmark this and revisit as the financial war unravels, sending Bitcoin violently higher,” Parks said on Feb. 3.

Altcoins may have just one last rally this cycle, but only those with real utility and strong network activity will see price gains, according to an analyst. 
“I think there will be one more breadth thrust from altcoins. The question is, is it a sustained rally that we will see for six to twelve months,” Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts told Real Vision co-founder Raoul Pal on an April 3 X livestream.
“At this stage, I am not too sure, but I do believe that quality altcoins where activity returns, activity drives prices …we will definitely see a recovery in some of these more high-quality names,” Coutts said.
Cointelegraph reported in January that there were over 36 million altcoins in existence. However, Ethereum still holds the majority share of total value locked (TVL) with 55.56%, followed by Solana (6.89%), Bitcoin (5.77%), BNB Smart Chain (5.68%), and Tron (5.54%), according to CoinGecko data.
Coutts said traders should watch where the network activity “is gravitating” and use that as their “north star” for how to trade in crypto, adding he sees an altcoin market upswing within the next two months. 
On March 28, Coutts told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin could reach all-time highs before the end of Q2 regardless of whether there is more clarity on US President Donald Trump's tariffs and potential recession concerns.

Blockchain network activity across the board has recently experienced sharp declines amid a broader crypto market downturn. On Feb. 21, Cointelegraph reported that the number of active addresses on the Solana (SOL) network fell to a weekly average of 9.5 million in February, down nearly 40% from the 15.6 million active addresses in November 2024.
Meanwhile, several key indicators the crypto industry uses to determine an incoming altcoin season suggest it's still nowhere in sight.
Capriole Investments’ Altcoin Speculation Index has dropped to 12%, down 53% since Dec. 25, the same period during which Ether fell 49% from $3,490, according to CoinMarketCap data.

However, while Bitcoin dominance — a level often watched for retracements that signal an altcoin season — sits at 62.84%, some analysts argue it’s no longer as relevant as a signal for altcoin season.
CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Yu recently said that Bitcoin Dominance “no longer defines altseason — trading volume does.”

84adb395f3f4613d3034af711b686c20,Cointelegraph,Genius Group says it’s been banned from buying more Bitcoin,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-firm-genius-group-orced-sell-bitcoin-treasury," The preliminary injunction blocking Bitcoin purchases is connected with a broader dispute surrounding a merger with Fatbrain AI that went sour in October last year. 
Singapore-based artificial intelligence firm Genius Group says it’s temporarily barred from expanding its Bitcoin treasury after a US court order has banned it from selling shares, raising funds and using investor funds to buy more Bitcoin.
A New York District court issued the preliminary injunction (PI) and temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 13 in connection with a broader dispute surrounding its merger with Fatbrain AI, the Genius Group said in an April 3 statement.
Fatbrain AI and Genius Group completed a merger and purchase agreement in March 2024, but by Oct. 30, Genius initiated arbitration procedures to terminate, alleging fraud by Fatbrain AI executives connected to the deal.

In February, Fatbrain AI executives Michael Moe and Peter Ritz filed for the TRO and permanent injunction, blocking Genius Group from selling its shares, raising funds and buying more Bitcoin pending the arbitration outcome. 
The injunction has forced Genius Group to close divisions, halt marketing activities and sell 10 Bitcoin (BTC) from its stash of 440, worth over $23 million at current prices, to continue funding its operations. The firm hasn’t ruled out more sales in the future.
“Genius is taking all necessary measures to minimize Bitcoin sales but anticipates that it will need to downsize its Bitcoin Treasury in the coming months in the event the PI remains in place,” the firm said.
Fatbrain AI shareholders also filed two lawsuits against Fatbrain AI executives, including Moe and Ritz, and Genius Group, in April 2024, alleging violation of federal securities laws in connection with the merger, ASX law said in an October statement.

Genius Group was subsequently voluntarily dismissed from the suits on Feb. 14. 
Genius Group says the US court injunction has also forced it to break Singapore law by halting share compensation to employees as part of its employment agreements.
“We never dreamed that it was possible that a US court could block the company from being able to issue shares, raise funds or buy Bitcoin — all actions that would normally be decided by a public company's shareholders or Board rather than a court,” said Genius Group CEO Roger James Hamilton.

He said the firm will “continue to fly the flag for Bitcoin,” even when legally banned from building out its treasury.
Fatbrain AI didn’t immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.
Artificial intelligence firm Genius Group first announced in November 2024 that it had taken the first steps to build a Bitcoin treasury by purchasing 110 Bitcoin for $10 million.
The firm had earlier announced its overall goal of committing 90% or more of its current and future reserves to be held in Bitcoin, with an initial target of $120 million, which saw the stock price surge by 66%.

6034707c43205510c9f2cba261199484,Cointelegraph,10-year Treasury yield falls to 4% as DXY softens — Is it time to buy the Bitcoin price dip?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/10-year-treasury-yield-falls-to-4-as-dxy-softens-is-it-time-to-buy-the-bitcoin-price-dip," Will the US-led trade war lead to a golden buying opportunity in Bitcoin price or further downside in the short term? 
On April 3, yields on long-term US government debt fell to their lowest levels in six months as investors reacted to growing concerns over the global trade war and the weakening of the US dollar. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly touched 4.0%, down from 4.4% a week earlier, signaling strong demand from buyers.

At first glance, a higher risk of economic recession may seem negative for Bitcoin (BTC). However, lower returns from fixed-income investments encourage allocations to alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Over time, traders are likely to reduce exposure to bonds, particularly if inflation rises. As a result, the path to a Bitcoin all-time high in 2025 remains plausible.
One could argue that the recently announced US import tariffs negatively impact corporate profitability, forcing some companies to deleverage and, in turn, reducing market liquidity. Ultimately, any measure that increases risk aversion tends to have a short-term negative effect on Bitcoin, particularly given its strong correlation with the S&P 500 index.
Axel Merk, chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Merk Investments, said that tariffs create a “supply shock,” meaning the reduced availability of goods and services due to rising prices causes an imbalance relative to demand. This effect is amplified if interest rates are declining, potentially paving the way for inflationary pressure.

Even if one does not view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, the appeal of fixed-income investments diminishes significantly in such a scenario. Moreover, if just 5% of the world’s $140 trillion bond market seeks higher returns elsewhere, it could translate into $7 trillion in potential inflows into stocks, commodities, real estate, gold, and Bitcoin.
Gold surged to a $21 trillion market capitalization as it made consecutive all-time highs, and it still has the potential for significant price upside. Higher prices allow previously unprofitable mining operations to resume and it encourages further investment in exploration, extraction, and refining. As production expands, the supply growth will naturally act as a limiting factor on gold’s long-term bull run.
Regardless of trends in US interest rates, the US dollar has weakened against a basket of foreign currencies, as measured by the DXY Index. On April 3, the index dropped to 102, its lowest level in six months. A decline in confidence in the US dollar, even in relative terms, could encourage other nations to explore alternative stores of value, including Bitcoin.

This transition does not happen overnight, but the trade war could lead to a gradual shift away from the US dollar, particularly among countries that feel pressured by its dominant role. While no one expects a return to the gold standard or Bitcoin to become a major component of national reserves, any movement away from the dollar strengthens Bitcoin’s long-term upside potential and reinforces its position as an alternative asset.

To put things in perspective, Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore collectively hold $2.63 trillion in US Treasuries. If these regions choose to retaliate, bond yields could reverse their trend, increasing the cost of new debt issuance for the US government and further weakening the dollar. In such a scenario, investors would likely avoid adding exposure to stocks, ultimately favoring scarce alternative assets like Bitcoin.
Timing Bitcoin’s market bottom is nearly impossible, but the fact that the $82,000 support level held despite worsening global economic uncertainty is an encouraging sign of its resilience.

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

66595a218897e37157256a0ed45907fe,Cointelegraph,"Cango sells legacy China business, goes all-in on Bitcoin mining: Report",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cango-sells-legacy-china-business-pursues-bitcoin-mining-report," The company reportedly sold its China operations to an entity associated with Bitmain for $352 million. 
Cango, a publicly traded Chinese conglomerate, has agreed to sell its legacy China operations to an entity associated with peer Bitmain in a bid to go all-in on Bitcoin (BTC) mining, according to a report by The Miner Mag. 
Cango agreed to sell its legacy Chinese auto financing business to Ursalpha Digital Limited in a $352 million deal, according to the report.
 Additionally, Bitmain is reportedly transferring 32 exahashes per second (EH/s) to Cango. The deal effectively brings Bitmain’s mining assets to the public market, The Miner Mag said.
Exahashes measure a miner’s contribution to the Bitcoin network’s hashrate, the total computing power securing the network.
The Miner Mag said Ursalpha Digital Limited has the same corporate address and founding director as Antalpha, an entity ultimately controlled by the chairman of Bitcoin miner Bitmain.

Bitmain has experienced US scrutiny after the country blacklisted its artificial intelligence affiliate Sopghgo, Bloomberg reported. 
According to Bloomberg, Bitmain has a working relationship with American Bitcoin, a Trump-family-affiliated mining entity created in March as part of a deal with Hut 8, a provider of power and computing infrastructure. 
On March 31, Hut 8 bought a majority ownership interest in American Bitcoin (formerly American Data Centers), whose founders include US President Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. 
Hut 8 has transferred its Bitcoin mining equipment to American Bitcoin, which is reportedly mulling an initial public offering (IPO), according to Bloomberg. 
The companies said that American Bitcoin will focus on crypto mining, while Hut 8 targets data center infrastructure for applications such as high-performance computing. 
In 2025, Bitcoin mining stocks have struggled amid declining cryptocurrency prices and pressure on business models caused by the Bitcoin network’s April halving, according to a JPMorgan research note shared with Cointelegraph.
Every four years, the amount of BTC mined per “block” — a bundle of transaction data stored on the chain — is cut in half. April’s halving slashed mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.
