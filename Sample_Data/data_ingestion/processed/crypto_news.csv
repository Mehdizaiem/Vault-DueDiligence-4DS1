c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

e33f43bff6d73a0907a42ea081706b62,Cointelegraph,American Bitcoin’s ambition is to dominate mining — Hut 8 CEO,https://cointelegraph.com/news/inside-the-trump-linked-american-bitcoin-mining-ambitions-to-dominate-the-industry-hut-8-ceo," In an exclusive interview, Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot reveals how the Trump-backed American Bitcoin venture is aiming to dominate US mining and ultimately take its vision public. 
Earlier this week, Bitcoin mining giant Hut 8 revealed a partnership that includes two members of the Trump family — Donald Jr. and Eric — and its plans to launch a new mining venture, American Bitcoin. 
In an exclusive interview on Decentralize with Cointelegraph’s Byte-Sized Insight series, Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot shared new details about the venture’s vision, why the timing was right and how the company plans to scale.
“We’ve thought about splitting out our Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure businesses for some time,” Genoot said. “Meeting Eric and Don Jr., and seeing their deep passion for Bitcoin and infrastructure, was the perfect catalyst.”
According to Genoot, the goal is clear: to build one of the world’s largest and most efficient Bitcoin mining platforms, rooted in American soil and aligned with pro-Bitcoin sentiment growing under President Donald  Trump’s administration. “Eric told me, ‘I don’t want to get involved in anything that isn’t the biggest and the best,’” he said.
The move comes at a pivotal moment for US-based mining. With China out of the picture post-2021 crackdown, and Washington now openly exploring the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, America’s place in the global mining ecosystem is under transformation.
Still, size isn’t everything. Genoot emphasized that efficiency and cost-effectiveness are core to the strategy.
Related: Bitcoin miner Hut 8 argues to toss ‘short and distort’ shareholder suit
American Bitcoin’s structure allows it to mine BTC at low cost, accumulate more when the market allows, and potentially expand into other Bitcoin ecosystem services. Hut 8 currently holds over 10,000 BTC on its balance sheet, worth up to $1 billion depending on market conditions. American Bitcoin aims to surpass that.
And the company isn’t just bullish on Bitcoin; it’s bullish on power consumption. Genoot pushed back on criticism that mining wastes energy: 
Looking ahead, Hut 8’s mining spinoff has big ambitions. “Our focus is scaling. Our focus is taking this company public on a US exchange,” Genoot said. “You’ll hear more from us soon.”

aecdd3ca70736675c58ff180b8fa61f5,Cointelegraph,Has Michael Saylor’s Strategy built a house of cards?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-strategy-house-of-cards," Has Saylor pushed Strategy too far? With MSTR at the center of clashing leveraged ETFs and convertible stock plays, the market is making its own bets. 
Strategy Inc, formerly MicroStrategy, has discarded its core product, assumed a new identity, swallowed over half a million Bitcoin, spawned equity classes with double-digit yields, and inspired an arsenal of leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — a unique and significant market phenomenon.
Michael Saylor’s firm has constructed a comprehensive financial framework based around Bitcoin (BTC), tying its corporate performance directly to the cryptocurrency’s price fluctuations. As a result, Strategy’s common stock has evolved into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure, its preferred shares offer yields tied to cryptocurrency risk, and a series of leveraged and inverse ETFs now track its equity movements, all fundamentally connected to its substantial Bitcoin holdings.
Recently, there was an announcement of another purchase by MSTR (Strategy’s common equity) of close to $2 billion of BTC in one clip, inviting even more raised eyebrows and caution.
This concern is not merely because of Strategy’s bet on Bitcoin but the market architecture that has grown around it. A parallel financial ecosystem has emerged, binding its fate to a risk asset that, as Saylor himself notes, trades 24/7. He’s championed the idea that “volatility is vitality,” suggesting that this constant motion draws attention, sustains interest, and breathes life into the entire “Strategyverse” and its related equities.
To some, this is financial innovation in its purest form: bold, unhedged and transformative. To others, it is a fragile lattice of conviction and leverage, one black swan away from unraveling.
MicroStrategy, once a staid business intelligence software provider, has been reborn as Strategy Inc, a corporate avatar synonymous with Bitcoin. The company has made an unabashed leap from offering data analytics to becoming a full-throttle Bitcoin acquisition vehicle.
The numbers speak for themselves. As of March 30, Strategy holds 528,185 BTC, acquired for approximately $35.63 billion at an average price of about $67,458 per Bitcoin. The most recent tranche of BTC in 2025 involved the acquisition of 22,048 BTC for around $1.92 billion, at an average of roughly $86,969 per coin. Year-to-date, Strategy has achieved a BTC yield of 11.0%.
This shift has transformed MSTR into a proxy Bitcoin ETF of sorts, albeit with operational leverage and corporate risk baked in. But unlike the US Securities and Exchange Commission-blessed spot ETFs, MSTR offers amplified exposure: It behaves like Bitcoin, only more so due to the company’s use of leverage and financial engineering.

Now, with the introduction of STRK (8% yield) and STRF (10% yield), Strategy has expanded its reach. These preferred shares offer fixed-income-style returns, but their performance is deeply tethered to Bitcoin’s fate. When Bitcoin surges, yield-bearing holders cheer. They’re still promised yield when it falls, but their capital risk climbs.
Financial innovation? Yes. Structural risk? Most certainly.
Market performance of Strategy-adjacent equities (Base = 100). Source: TradingView
When indexed to 100 at the start of 2025, the performance of Strategy and related instruments demonstrates the effects of volatility and leverage in the Bitcoin-correlated financial ecosystem. As of early April 2025, MSTR has declined moderately by approximately 8%, tracking the broader downward trajectory of Bitcoin itself, which is down around 16%.
The company’s preferred shares, STRF and STRK, have slightly appreciated above their initial indexed values, reflecting investor preference for dividend stability amid market volatility.
MSTU and MSTX have markedly underperformed, dropping around 37%–38% from their normalized starting points due to volatility drag and compounding losses inherent in leveraged daily reset structures.
This YTD snapshot underscores how leverage magnifies returns and the potential risks associated with short-term market movements.
Strategy’s operating income, still derived from its legacy software business, now plays second fiddle to its crypto balance sheet.
However, the firm hasn’t just stockpiled coins; it has created a latticework of financial instruments that reflect and refract BTC price action. MSTR is no longer merely equity; it has become a high-beta Bitcoin play. STRK and STRF are yield-bearing hybrids, offering fixed returns yet functioning like risk instruments in a crypto-linked treasury experiment.
The structural concern is this: By tying every new yield product, equity issuance and debt vehicle to Bitcoin, Strategy has effectively replaced diversification with correlation. Critics argue there is no hedge here, only degrees of bullishness.
This raises the concern that a company can maintain corporate solvency and investor trust when its financial ecosystem is built atop the volatility of a single, historically unstable asset.
Where there is heat, there will be leverage. The market has responded to Strategy’s gravitational pull by creating a suite of leveraged and inverse products tied to MSTR, giving retail and institutional players access to turbocharged Bitcoin exposure without holding the asset directly.
Investors seeking amplified returns in anticipation of price gains can deploy strategies such as MSTU (T Rex) or MSTX (Defiance), both offering 2x long daily returns, or MST3.L, which provides 3x long exposure listed in London.
Conversely, investors expecting price declines might choose SMST, offering 2x short exposure, or MSTS.L and 3SMI, each providing 3x short exposure listed in London.
These instruments are typically employed by traders looking for short-term directional bets and should be handled cautiously due to daily reset mechanics and volatility risks.
These are not traditional ETFs. They are complex, synthetic instruments with daily reset mechanisms and inherent decay risks. Volatility drag ensures that even in a sideways market, leveraged longs underperform. For shorts, the risk of a short squeeze, particularly in parabolic bull runs, is ever-present.
Related: Trade war puts Bitcoin’s status as safe-haven asset in doubt
In practical terms, these products allow traders to speculate on MSTR’s price with minimal capital outlay. But they also amplify misalignment. A trader betting on Bitcoin’s month-long trend might find that their 3x long MSTR ETF underperforms expectations due to compounding losses on down days.
The strategic risk here lies in mismatch: Retail investors may perceive these ETFs as direct Bitcoin exposure with leverage. In reality, they are trading a proxy of a proxy, subject to corporate news, dilution and macro shifts.

Between 2020 and 2025, Strategy has executed over a dozen capital raises via convertible notes, ATM equity programs and, most recently, the STRF preferred offering priced at a 10% yield. The March 2025 raise helped fund the latest $1.92-billion Bitcoin buy.
It is not just about buying Bitcoin. It is about the market constructing a meta-structure where every market instrument, common stock, preferred shares and synthetic ETFs feeds into the same gravitational pull. Each capital raise buys more Bitcoin. Each purchase pushes up sentiment. Each ETF amplifies exposure. This feedback loop has become the hallmark of Strategy’s financial architecture.
With each new issuance, however, dilution risk grows. STRK and STRF investors depend not only on Strategy’s solvency but also on Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation. If BTC stumbles into a prolonged bear market, can those 10% yields continue? 
For investors, Strategy’s approach presents clear opportunities and risks. It offers a streamlined pathway for gaining exposure to Bitcoin through familiar financial instruments, combining elements of equity, fixed income and derivatives. At the same time, investors must carefully consider the volatility of Bitcoin itself, the potential impacts of dilution from continuous capital raises, and the overall health of Strategy’s balance sheet.
Ultimately, the investment outcome will heavily depend on the trajectory of cryptocurrency markets, Strategy’s financial management and evolving regulatory landscapes.

f262033bd0add398caba0db7ca2433e3,Cointelegraph,Trump tariffs squeeze already struggling Bitcoin miners — Braiins exec,https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-tariffs-bitcoin-mining-impact," “It will take a decade for the US to catch up with cutting-edge chip manufacturing,” Braiins chief marketing officer Kristian Csepcsar said. 
The new trade tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump may place added pressure on the Bitcoin mining ecosystem both domestically and globally, according to one industry executive.
While the US is home to Bitcoin (BTC) mining manufacturing firms such as Auradine, it’s still “not possible to make the whole supply chain, including materials, US-based,” Kristian Csepcsar, chief marketing officer at BTC mining tech provider Braiins, told Cointelegraph.
On April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs, imposing a 10% tariff on all countries that export to the US and introducing “reciprocal” levies targeting America’s key trading partners.
Community members have debated the potential effects of the tariffs on Bitcoin, with some saying their impact has been overstated, while others see them as a significant threat.
Csepcsar said the mining industry is already experiencing tough times, pointing to key indicators like the BTC hashprice.
Hashprice — a measure of a miner’s daily revenue per unit of hash power spent to mine BTC blocks — has been on the decline since 2022 and dropped to all-time lows of $50 for the first time in 2024.
According to data from Bitbo, the BTC hashprice was still hovering around all-time low levels of $53 on March 30.

“Hashprice is the key metric miners follow to understand their bottom line. It is how many dollars one terahash makes a day. A key profitability metric, and it is at all-time lows, ever,” Csepcsar said.
He added that mining equipment tariffs were already increasing under the Biden administration in 2024, and cited comments from Summer Meng, general manager at Chinese crypto mining supplier Bitmars.
Source: Summer Meng
“But they keep getting stricter under Trump,” Csepcsar added, referring to companies such as the China-based Bitmain — the world’s largest ASIC manufacturer —  which is subject to the new tariffs.
Trump’s latest measures include a 34% additional tariff on top of an existing 20% levy for Chinese mining imports. In response, China reportedly imposed its own retaliatory tariffs on April 4.
Csepcsar also noted that cutting-edge chips for crypto mining are currently massively produced in countries like Taiwan and South Korea, which were hit by new 32% and 25% tariffs, respectively.
“It will take a decade for the US to catch up with cutting-edge chip manufacturing. So again, companies, including American ones, lose in the short term,” he said.

Csepcsar also observed that some countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States region, including Russia and Kazakhstan, have been beefing up mining efforts and could potentially overtake the US in hashrate dominance.

“If we continue to see trade war, these regions with low tariffs and more favorable mining conditions can see a major boom,” Csepcsar warned.
As the newly announced tariffs potentially hurt Bitcoin mining both globally and in the US, it may become more difficult for Trump to keep his promise of making the US the global mining leader.
Trump’s stance on crypto has shifted multiple times over the years. As his administration embraces a more pro-crypto agenda, it remains to be seen how the latest economic policies will impact his long-term strategy for digital assets.

Update (April 4, 1:45 pm UTC: This article has been updated to add a comment from an OKX spokesperson.
Cryptocurrency exchange OKX is under regulatory scrutiny in Europe after Maltese authorities issued a fine for violations of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in the past.
Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) fined Okcoin Europe — OKX’s Europe-based arm — 1.1 million euros ($1.2 million) after detecting multiple AML failures on the platform in 2023, the authority announced on April 3.
While admitting that OKX has significantly improved its AML policies in the past 18 months, the authority “could not ignore” its compliance failures from 2023, “some of which were deemed to be serious and systematic,” the FIAU said.
OKX was among the first crypto exchanges to receive a license under Europe’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation via its Malta hub in January 2025.
The FIAU stated that at the time of the compliance examination in 2023, OKX compiled a business risk assessment (BRA) in an attempt to identify threats and vulnerabilities.
The regulators found multiple deficiencies within the BRA’s methodology, making OKX unable to properly access the money laundering risks it was exposed to and to take necessary measures to manage them, it said.
Some of those risks included potential threats from the use of cryptocurrency mixers or tumblers, privacy coins, stablecoins and the usage of tokens on decentralized exchanges.

The FIAU statement also mentioned money laundering risks associated with Okcoin Europe’s exposure to other jurisdictions despite its pledge to only service European customers. It stated:
A spokesperson for OKX did not respond to Cointelegraph’s request to comment on whether the exchange admitted to such wrongdoing in the past.
“With this chapter behind us, OKX remains focused on the future — continuing to build a secure, transparent, and compliant platform for our users worldwide,” the representative said.
The news on the $1.2 million penalty in Malta came soon after Bloomberg in March reported that European Union regulators were probing OKX over its potential role in facilitating the laundering of $100 million in funds from the Bybit hack.
Bybit CEO Ben Zhou previously claimed that OKX’s Web3 proxy allowed hackers to launder roughly $100 million, or 40,233 Ether (ETH), from the $1.5 billion hack, which occurred in February 2025.

In response to Zhou’s allegations, OKX denied claims that there were any ongoing investigations by the EU authorities, adding that “Bybit’s statements are spreading misinformation.”

The latest news from Malta’s FIAU also followed recent reports suggesting that OKX hired former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to advise it over the federal criminal investigation leading to its plea and a $505 million penalty payment in the US.
OKX’s new penalty in Malta sets a precedent in the context of regulators dealing with past compliance violations by MiCA-licensed companies, showing that the license does not spare the firms from responsibility for past breaches.

Authorities in the US state of Massachusetts continue targeting unlawful cryptocurrency market practices, with a local court fining crypto financial services firm CLS Global.
A federal court in Boston on April 2 sentenced CLS Global on criminal charges related to fraudulent manipulation of crypto trading volume, according to an announcement from the Massachusetts US Attorney’s Office.
In addition to a $428,059 fine, the court prohibited CLS Global from offering services in the US for a probation period of three years.
CLS Global, a crypto market maker registered in the United Arab Emirates, in January pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit market manipulation and one count of wire fraud.
The charges against CLS Global followed an undercover law enforcement operation involving NexFundAI, a token created by the FBI as part of a sting operation in May 2024.
CLS Global was among at least three firms that took the FBI’s bait and agreed to provide “market maker services” for NexFundAI, including a fraudulent scheme to attract investors to purchase the token.
In October 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced fraud charges against CLS and its employee, Andrey Zhorzhes. The US securities regulator also filed complaints against two other NexFundAI manipulators, Hong Kong-linked ZM Quant Investment and Russia-linked Gotbit Consulting.
According to CLS Global CEO Filipp Veselov, the company was founded in 2017 to fill in a “huge gap in the market for high-quality market-making solutions and trading consulting.”
Prior to CLS, Veselov worked at the Russian cryptocurrency exchange platform Latoken, which is advertised as a “global digital asset exchange” and has about 370,000 followers on X.
The CLS team also includes chief revenue officer Pavel Singaevskii, who previously served as sales manager at Stex, a crypto platform that reportedly ceased operations without warning in 2023.

According to CLS Global’s X page, the platform continues operating and has more than 110,000 followers at the time of publication.
Wash trading is an illegal practice involving artificially inflating trading volume by repeatedly buying and selling the same asset, generating a misleading perception of demand.
According to a January 2025 report by the US blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the crypto market has at least $2.6 billion in estimated wash traded volumes, or just about 2% of total daily crypto trading volumes, as reported by CoinGecko.

Some studies indicate that wash trading makes up a bigger share of the crypto market.
In 2022, the US National Bureau of Economic Research reported that illegal wash trading may account for as much as 70% of average trading volumes on unregulated exchanges.

The value locked in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (BTCFi) has surged by more than 2,700% over the past year, potentially transforming Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a productive, yield-bearing asset, according to new research from Binance.
BTCFi is a new technological paradigm that aims to bring decentralized finance capabilities to Bitcoin’s base layer. It is one of the fastest-growing crypto sectors, reaching a total value locked (TVL) of over $8.6 billion.
The growing value of BTCFi, “along with potential interest rate cuts, may reinforce positive sentiment for Bitcoin in the medium and long term,” Binance Research wrote in a report shared with Cointelegraph.

If the BTCFi sector’s growth trajectory continues, it could open up “new opportunities for Bitcoin holders to generate yield through lending, liquidity provision, and other DeFi mechanisms,” a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding:

Interest in BTCFi surged after April 2024’s Bitcoin halving, which introduced the Runes protocol, the first fungible token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Several Bitcoin-native projects have helped accelerate the trend. 
Babylon introduced Bitcoin (BTC) staking for the first time in the network’s history, enabling holders to earn passive income from their assets.

Long-term holders are wallets that have been holding BTC for at least 155 days. Growing accumulation from long-term holders has reduced the available Bitcoin supply on exchanges, which may eventually lead to a supply shock-driven price rally.
The growing accumulation trend among long-term holders aligns with a “significant period of adoption for Bitcoin,” due to the establishment of the US strategic Bitcoin reserve and growing institutional interest, according to the research report.

On March 7, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve using BTC seized from government criminal cases.
Trump signed the historic Bitcoin reserve order a day ahead of hosting the first White House Crypto Summit, which received mixed reactions from the crypto community.

Swapping and bridging may be required. To sell, you might need to convert tokens to ETH or stablecoins and bridge them to the Ethereum mainnet.
MetaMask integrates fiat off-ramps. You can use the MetaMask Portfolio to sell ETH directly, but be prepared for KYC with third-party providers.
Non-KYC and P2P options exist. Platforms like Bisq or LocalCoinSwap allow trading without ID, but they carry more risk and require caution.
There are plenty of ways you might end up with a mix of different cryptocurrencies sitting in your MetaMask wallet.
Maybe you work in Web3 — as a developer, copywriter or designer — and your client paid you in their project’s native token.
Or maybe you’re part of a Bitcoin mining pool and occasionally receive rewards straight to your wallet.
You could be farming yield in decentralized finance (DeFi), earning annual percentage yield (APY) on your locked assets. Or, perhaps the most straightforward of all: You completed a few SocialFi tasks and received some community tokens via an airdrop.
Whatever the case, you’ve got crypto in your MetaMask — and now you want to turn it into cash.
In this guide, you’ll learn all the ways you can sell your crypto and withdraw the funds to your bank account or even in cash — whether you’re going through official Know Your Customer (KYC) channels or sticking to more private, non-KYC routes.
Before you can turn your tokens into cash, there are a few things you need to get sorted in MetaMask because “not all tokens are created equal.” It’s not always as simple as hitting a “sell” button — especially if you’ve just received tokens via an airdrop or from a lesser-known project.
Just because a token shows up in your wallet doesn’t mean it’s ready to be sold. In fact, many airdropped tokens aren’t listed on exchanges at all. That means there’s no market where you can sell them — not yet, anyway. You might see a price attached to the token, but without buyers or liquidity, that value isn’t something you can actually realize right now. So, while it’s great to receive free tokens, they may end up sitting idle in your wallet for a while.
Did you know? If you see a “100% sell fee detected” warning on a token, it’s likely a scam. Scammers airdrop these tokens, hoping you’ll try to sell or interact with them. But when you do, the smart contract takes the full amount — leaving you with nothing. Worse, some link to fake decentralized applications (DApps) that ask you to “claim” or “unlock” the tokens. Connecting your wallet or signing a transaction there can let scammers drain your real assets.
Sometimes, you’ll receive tokens that don’t even show up in MetaMask at first. That doesn’t mean they’re not there — it just means MetaMask doesn’t recognize them by default. You’ll need to add them manually by grabbing the token’s contract address (usually from the project’s official site or Etherscan) and importing it into your wallet. Once you do that, your balance will show up properly.
Similarly, if you want to receive any asset other than Ether (ETH), the “Import Tokens” option lets you manually add these missing tokens so they show up in the assets list.
Even if your tokens are visible in MetaMask and technically have value, that doesn’t always mean you can sell them for cash right away. Many smaller or newer tokens don’t have direct fiat trading pairs — so you won’t be able to exchange them straight into dollars or euros. 
To get around this, you’ll usually need to swap them for something more liquid, like ETH or a stablecoin such as USDC (USDC), which are more commonly supported by fiat off-ramps.
In some cases, your tokens might also be sitting on a different blockchain — like Arbitrum, BNB Chain or Polygon — while most fiat withdrawal options only support Ethereum mainnet. When that’s the case, you’ll need to bridge your tokens over to Ethereum before you can sell them.
One way to handle both of these steps — swapping and bridging — is by using platforms that combine them into a single flow. For example, with Symbiosis.finance, you can swap a token on one chain and receive a more widely accepted token on Ethereum, all in one transaction. This can save you a few steps and reduce the chance of user error when hopping between tools.
The simplest way to sell crypto that you hold on MetaMask is by using the application itself. Here’s what to do:
Open MetaMask portfolio: In your MetaMask extension or app, click the “Buy & Sell” button. This will take you to the MetaMask Portfolio site, where you can manage all your assets and begin the selling process.
Start the sale process: Click on “Move crypto” at the top of the page and select “Sell” from the dropdown options.
Choose your region and currency: MetaMask will ask for your country of residence and preferred fiat currency. This step ensures you’re shown accurate provider options and payout methods available in your area.
Enter sale amount: Select Ether and enter how much you’d like to convert.
Pick a payout option: Next, choose where you want the fiat to go. Depending on your region and provider availability, you might be able to send it to a bank account, PayPal or another method.
Compare offers: MetaMask aggregates offers from several third-party providers (like MoonPay, Transak, Sardine, etc.), showing you real-time exchange rates, fees and estimated payout times. Take a moment to compare and pick the best option for you.
Complete the sale: Once you’ve chosen a provider, MetaMask will guide you through sending the crypto. You’ll confirm the transaction in your wallet, and the funds will be transferred to the provider, who handles the fiat payout.
There are two things to keep in mind when using the MetaMask application:
Firstly, while the application itself might not ask you for KYC, the third-party providers will. So, expect to get your documents ready for this one.
Secondly, MetaMask’s sell feature only supports ETH on the Ethereum mainnet. This is where the bridging will come in as was explained earlier.
If you’d rather cash out your crypto through a centralized exchange, Coinbase is a popular option. It’s beginner-friendly, offers fiat withdrawals, and supports a wide range of assets. Just note: You’ll need to complete KYC verification before withdrawing any fiat.
Here’s how to do it, step by step:
First things first: You’ll need to move your funds from MetaMask to Coinbase.
Log in to your Coinbase account and hit “Send & Receive” at the top.
Switch to the “Receive” tab, pick the crypto you’re sending (like ETH or USDC), and copy the wallet address Coinbase gives you.
Make sure the network matches — for example, if you’re sending ETH, it should be on the Ethereum (ERC-20) network.
Now open MetaMask:
Click “Send,” paste in that Coinbase address, and enter how much you want to transfer.
Double-check the network — if you send it to the wrong one, your funds could disappear.
Hit “Confirm,” and your crypto should show up in Coinbase after a few minutes.
Once your funds land in Coinbase, it’s time to cash out.
Head to “Buy & Sell” at the top and switch to the “Sell” tab.
Choose the crypto you just received and decide how much you want to sell.
Pick where you want the money to go — like your linked bank account, PayPal or your Coinbase balance.
Review the details (including any fees), then hit “Sell.”
Did you know? When withdrawing via centralized exchanges, be cautious of minimum withdrawal amounts and any associated fees. Check these details in advance to make sure the limits and costs are acceptable to you before committing to this route.
With peer-to-peer (P2P), you’re not selling your crypto to the exchange. Instead, you’re selling it to another user. You choose a buyer based on their offer and preferred payment method (like bank transfer, Revolut, Wise, etc.). Once they send the money to your account, you release the crypto to them. The platform holds your crypto in escrow during the process, so no one can just disappear with your funds.
With centralized exchanges, you’ll have to complete KYC before you’re able to trade in this manner. 
Go to Trade > P2P.
Choose the coin you want to sell and browse the list of available buyers.
Select a deal, confirm the order, and wait for the buyer to make the payment.
Once the payment has arrived in your account, confirm it and release the crypto from escrow.
Did you know? Some peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchanges offer a “cash by mail” option, allowing users to send physical cash through postal services or couriers to settle transactions.
For those looking to convert cryptocurrency from their MetaMask wallet to fiat currency without undergoing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, there are still a few viable paths.
Decentralized P2P platforms let you trade directly with other users, much like their centralized counterparts, though often with minimal or no KYC requirements. 
LocalCoinSwap: A non-custodial P2P marketplace that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and payment methods, including cash. It offers escrow protection and emphasizes privacy.
Bisq: A fully decentralized exchange that supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Monero (XMR). It runs on a peer-to-peer protocol and doesn’t require user accounts or KYC.
However, without KYC, you’re responsible for vetting the person you’re trading with. Check their reputation, review any available trade history, and always follow platform safety guidelines.
Withdrawing funds from your MetaMask wallet using cryptocurrency ATMs — often referred to as Bitcoin ATMs — is an option that allows you to convert your digital assets into cash. Here’s how you can approach this method:
Locate a cryptocurrency ATM: Begin by finding a cryptocurrency ATM in your vicinity. Websites like CoinATMRadar provide directories of Bitcoin ATM locations worldwide, detailing the services they offer and the cryptocurrencies they support.
Prepare your MetaMask wallet: Ensure that the cryptocurrency you intend to withdraw is supported by the ATM. Bitcoin ATMs predominantly support Bitcoin (BTC), so you may need to use a decentralized exchange (DEX) to swap your current tokens for BTC within your MetaMask wallet. Be mindful of transaction fees and exchange rates during this process.
Initiate the withdrawal process: At the ATM, select the option to withdraw cash. The machine will prompt you to specify the amount you wish to withdraw and provide a QR code representing the ATM’s wallet address.
Transfer funds from MetaMask: Using your MetaMask wallet, scan the QR code provided by the ATM to input the recipient address accurately. Enter the exact amount of cryptocurrency required and confirm the transaction. Be aware that network congestion can affect transaction times.
Collect your cash: Once the blockchain confirms the transaction, the ATM will dispense the equivalent amount in cash, minus any applicable fees. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to longer, depending on network conditions.
When using crypto ATMs, you should expect very high fees, and while small transactions don’t usually require KYC, larger ones still might.
Taxes aren’t the most exciting topic, but they matter when converting crypto from a MetaMask wallet into fiat. Selling crypto, whether through MetaMask, an exchange or a P2P deal, may trigger a taxable event, and understanding the applicable rules is essential.
In most countries, including the US, selling crypto for fiat (like US dollars, euros, etc.) is treated like selling property. That means if you bought ETH at $1,000 and sold it later for $1,500, you’ve made a $500 capital gain — and that’s usually taxable.
Even swapping one crypto for another (say, ETH for USDC) can trigger the same kind of tax obligation, even if no fiat is involved. So, yeah, it’s not just cashing out that counts — any trade can be reportable.
To stay on top of it, keep a record of:
When you bought and sold each asset
How much you bought and/or sold
What it was worth in fiat at the time
Any fees paid along the way.
These details make life way easier when tax season rolls around — or if your accountant gives you that look.
Crypto laws aren’t one-size-fits-all. Every country has its own stance, and even within the same country, rules can vary depending on how you’re using crypto.
In the US, for example, selling crypto could fall under capital gains tax rules or even money transmission laws, depending on how you’re moving the funds. Other countries might have more lenient — or much stricter — regulations.
So, here’s what to do:
Look up your local crypto tax laws (even if they seem vague or outdated).
Stay current — regulations are evolving fast.
Talk to a pro if you’re unsure. A crypto-savvy accountant or legal adviser can help you avoid nasty surprises.
Even if you’re using non-KYC methods or decentralized tools, tax authorities may still expect a full report. Being proactive about it will save you headaches later — and might even save you money.
Happy cashing out!

2930342e49179a5f6f3a7f445b809635,Cointelegraph,Babylon users unstake $21M in Bitcoin following token airdrop,https://cointelegraph.com/news/babylon-21-million-unstaked-baby-airdrop," Over $21 million in Bitcoin was unstaked from Babylon as early users claimed 600 million BABY tokens in the platform’s latest airdrop. 
Update April 4, 10:40 am UTC: This article has been updated to insert comments from Bitlayer co-founder Kevin He. 
More than $21 million worth of Bitcoin was unstaked from the Babylon protocol in the 24 hours after the platform’s token airdrop, according to blockchain data shared by a developer.
On April 4, Bitfeed developer Mononaut shared that in the previous 24 hours, 256 Bitcoin (BTC) had been unstaked from the staking protocol. Mononaut said that the unstaking transactions paid 1.35 BTC in fees and consumed 1.318 Megavirtualbytes (MvB) of blockspace. This means the transactions generated high fees and occupied roughly a third of an entire Bitcoin block. 
The activity followed Babylon’s 600 million airdrop of its native token, BABY, which was distributed to early users and contributors.

In a previous Cointelegraph interview, Babylon co-founder Fisher Yu said that, unlike Ethereum and Solana, Bitcoin staking does not reward stakers in the chain’s native asset. Instead, they may get rewards in the form of the native token of the blockchain secured by the staked Bitcoin capital. 
On April 3, the Babylon Foundation announced the details of the airdrop program for its early adopters. The protocol said the airdrop was dedicated to its Phase 1 stakers, non-fungible token (NFT) holders and developers contributing to its ecosystem. 
The staking protocol said it was airdropping 600 million BABY tokens, 6% of its total supply; 30 million BABY were allocated to the protocol’s Pioneer Pass NFT holders, while 5 million BABY were slated for open-source contributors. 
The rest of the tokens were to be distributed among eligible stakers who participated in the protocol’s Phase 1. This included a stake participation airdrop of 30 million BABY, a base staking reward airdrop of 335 million BABY and a bonus staking reward airdrop for Phase 2 transition of 200 million BABY.  
While the platform distributed an airdrop for its early adopters, it clarified that it did not include wallet campaigns and liquid staking incentives in this airdrop event. 
In response to the airdrop, crypto exchange OKX listed the BABY token and USDT pair in pre-market futures. Pre-market futures allow traders to speculate on an asset’s future price. This allows investors to trade BABY futures before the asset becomes available in spot markets.
Even though millions in BTC were unstaked after the airdrop, the effect may be minimal. Bitlayer co-founder Kevin He told Cointelegraph this was “common short-term market behavior.” 
The executive said this simply represents early redemption. Furthermore, He said the high transaction fees stem from Babylon’s initial design and do not impact its long-term value. 
He added that Babylon garnered significant attention with its tokenomics and airdrop, which boosts community engagement. The executive said the protocol plays a “key role” in Bitcoin DeFi, pushing Bitcoin beyond being simply a store of value. 
Data platform DefiLlama shows that Babylon currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $4.29 billion. This represents 80% of the Bitcoin ecosystem’s overall TVL of $5.34 billion.
