The Bitcoin sell-off, which dominated a majority of the weak, appears to be easing off, with BTC price making a recovery back in the $80,000 range to reach an intra-day high at $85,120. 
Some traders believe that Bitcoin (BTC) was overdue for a bounce, given how deeply oversold some of its technical indicators had become. Those holding that belief warn that once bids are filled near the recent lows, if new buyers fail to sustain the momentum or negative macroeconomic newsflow resumes, BTC is likely to revisit its recent lows. 
HighStrike head of options and crypto trading JJ took a different view, noting that “Coinbase spot bids” were “filled,” representing the “first flip of bids outweighing asks now since the September bottom at $52,000.”

Regardless of the short-term price action from Bitcoin, many analysts continue to say that historical data highlights the recent drawdown as a prime purchasing opportunity.

From a technical perspective, chartered market analyst Aksel Kibar described Bitcoin’s sweep of the $78,000 level as a “sharp retest” but declined to say whether a price bottom had been achieved.

Momentum and technical traders should note that Bitcoin daily RSI remains in deeply oversold territory, and despite the strength of today’s rebound, the daily candlestick pattern of lower highs and lower lows. Failure to establish a daily close candlestick that generates a higher high could be an early sign that the downtrend is not yet complete.

5d9065ab27697108d5d473ff9551d0fb,Cointelegraph,States likely to adopt Bitcoin reserves first: Report,https://cointelegraph.com/news/states-adopt-bitcoin-reserves-first-senator-lummis," US Senator Cynthia Lummis expects progress toward a Bitcoin reserve to be slower at the federal level. 
States are likely to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) reserves before the US federal government does, Senator Cynthia Lummis reportedly said on Feb. 28 during the Bitcoin Investor Week conference in New York. 
“My bets are that you’ll see a state have a Bitcoin strategic reserve before the federal government,” Lummis said, according to a Bloomberg report. 
In July 2024, Lummis, a Wyoming Republican, proposed legislation that would require the US federal government to create a national Bitcoin stockpile. 
Her bill, dubbed the BITCOIN Act, calls for the US Treasury Department to gradually accumulate 1 million BTC, ultimately acquiring “a total stake of approximately 5% of total Bitcoin supply, mirroring the size and scope of gold reserves held by the United States,” according to Lummis’ website.

In January, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring federal officials to study the feasibility of a national Bitcoin stockpile. It was one of the first actions of Trump’s second presidential term, which started on Jan. 20. 
In February, Trump signed another order instructing the US government to create a sovereign wealth fund, which could potentially serve as a vehicle for buying BTC.
“We’re seeing the United Arab Emirates purchase Bitcoin. You’re going to look at some of the sovereign wealth funds around the world who are not as tied up in a democratic republic like we are, be able to just make it so,” Lummis reportedly said. 
There are currently 18 US states that have crypto reserve bills pending Senate votes, while two — Arizona and Utah —  are in the final stages of the approval process.
State crypto investment bills have been rejected in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota and Pennsylvania. 
Although some states run by Democrats might resist Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, others are expected to embrace crypto as a bipartisan issue. 
“[T]here are so many states out there that are pro-crypto, and they don’t necessarily follow blue or red policies,” Ashley Gunn, Coinbase’s senior manager for US policy, said during a Feb. 28 ETHDenver panel attended by Cointelegraph. 
Establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States would accelerate Bitcoin’s adoption even more than 2024’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches, cryptocurrency researcher CoinShares said in January.
“We believe that the enactment of the Bitcoin Act in the United States would have a more profound long-term impact on Bitcoin than the launch of ETFs,” CoinShares said.
Launched in January 2024, US-based Bitcoin ETFs hold upward of $100 billion worth of BTC.

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

9dee862da1b6d7fca85ae383034d3283,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin’s ‘Trump trade’ is over — Traders shift hope to Fed rate cuts, expanding global liquidity",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-trump-trade-is-over-will-fed-rate-cuts-and-m2-expansion-help," The pre-and-post-election Trump trade sent Bitcoin to new highs, but the jig is up. Traders now shift their hope to the resumption of QE and expanding global liquidity. 
Financial markets are sending mixed signals as uncertainty reaches new highs. On Feb. 25, the US debt ceiling was raised from $36.1 trillion to $40.1 trillion, marking another massive expansion in government borrowing.
Following a historical pattern, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield reacted to the news by dropping from 4.4% to 4.29%. While this may seem counterintuitive, markets tend to interpret debt ceiling resolutions as stabilizing events, reducing near-term uncertainty even if they imply higher borrowing down the line.
However, the stock and crypto markets, which usually benefit from lower bond yields as capital rotates into risk assets, have continued their fall that started last week. Since Feb. 21, the S&P 500 has lost 3%, the Nasdaq100 has dropped 5%, and Bitcoin has plunged 16%. The leading cryptocurrency is now trading 26% below its all-time high reached on President Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day, effectively erasing the Trump pump. 
A simultaneous decline in stocks and bond yields is not typical market behavior and suggests growing risk aversion and economic slowdown fears. 
Recent US economic data released on Feb. 21 has shown notable signs of weakness. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell to 64.7 in February, down from 71.7 in January. This marks the lowest level since November 2023 and came in below the preliminary estimate of 67.8, which was also the consensus forecast among economists polled by Reuters. 
Existing home sales dropped 4.9%, and the S&P Global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell from 52.7 in January to 50.4, the lowest since Sept. 2023. PMI tracks manufacturing and services activity, and a reading barely above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction indicates stagnating growth in the private sector.
Trade tensions add to market uncertainty. On Feb. 24, Trump said that tariffs on Canada and Mexico “will go forward” after the deadline for the monthlong delay ends next week. Trump’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on the European Union, revealed on Feb. 26, and an additional 10% levy on Chinese goods added to the growing market anxiety 
In commentary to CNBC, Chris Rupkey, Chief Economist at FWDBonds, unapologetically said, 
Rupkey elaborated, “The economy is coming in for a crash landing this year. Bet on it. The bond market is.” 
In the crypto market, the Fear & Greed Index has plunged to 10, or Extreme Fear - a stark contrast to the Greed levels seen at the beginning of February.

In January, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes speculated that a battle over the debt ceiling—combined with a reluctance to spend down the Treasury General Account—could push 10-year Treasury yields above 5%, triggering a stock market crash and forcing the the Federal Reserve to intervene. 
In his view, this could help President Trump to pressure the Fed into adopting a mode dovish stance. In other words, a small crisis to justify the QE and stimulate the economy. 
For Hayes, this mini-crisis must occur early in Trump’s presidency, during  Q1 or Q2, so he could blame it on the leverage built up during the Biden administration. 
Ironically, even though the debt ceiling was raised with minimal drama, and 10-year Treasury yields have actually fallen, the stock market still dropped. The most pressing question now is whether this will lead to interest rate cuts.
The Fed remains neutral, with recent economic data providing little reason for an imminent policy shift. The latest CPI report on Feb. 11 showed inflation accelerating to 0.5% month-over-month, pushing the annual rate to 3%, both exceeding expectations. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that the central bank won’t rush to cut rates further. Despite this position, a combination of weakening economic indicators and liquidity expansion may eventually force the Fed’s hand later this year.

Despite the current market downturn, not all hope is lost, as a massive wave of liquidity expansion could be on the horizon. The expanding M2 global liquidity supply could breathe fresh air into the risk-on markets, especially Bitcoin. However, this might take some time.
The M2 Global Liquidity Index 3-Month Offset provides a useful framework for forecasting liquidity-driven market movements. This indicator shifts M2 money supply data forward by three months to analyze its relationship with risk assets.

The historical performance shows that BTC usually lags approximately 60 days behind major global liquidity movements. The current drop inscribes perfectly into this picture, which also promises a strong rebound by June if liquidity trends hold.
Jeff Park, head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, echoed the sentiment:

Tether’s competitors are exerting increasingly more pressure to push the world’s largest stablecoin issuer out of the crypto market, including political pressure aimed at reducing the firm’s leading market share.
In the wider crypto markets, analysts are suggesting that most cryptocurrencies won’t see a widespread “altcoin season” rally in 2025, and only select tokens with sustainable investor interest and revenue-generating models will be able to outperform the rest of the tokens.
Tether’s competitors are working to push the world’s largest stablecoin issuer out of the crypto market, according to the company’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino.
Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDt (USDT), has a market capitalization of more than $142 billion — over twice as large as Circle’s USD Coin’s (USDC) $56 billion, according to Cointelegraph data.
However, the stablecoin issuer faces mounting pressure from competing firms and politicians, Ardoino said in a Feb. 25 X post.
“I’ll leave it to you to define a competitor trying to use lawfare to kill an opponent, instead of focusing on better products,” Ardoino added.
Tether will continue focusing on its mission to promote global financial inclusion, particularly in underdeveloped economies, Ardoino said, noting that USDT is used by more than 400 million people and gains 35 million new wallets each quarter.
Ardoino’s comments followed Tether’s exclusion from the list of 10 firms approved to issue stablecoins under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework.

Most cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ether may not experience a widespread “altcoin season” rally in 2025, but projects with strong fundamentals and revenue-generating models could outperform the broader market, according to Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of CryptoQuant.
“Most altcoins won’t make it” during the 2025 market cycle, Ju wrote in a Feb. 25 X post.
Cryptocurrencies with potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals, robust revenue-generating models and sustained investor attention may outperform the rest of the market, Ju said. Still, “The era of everything pumping is over,” he added.

Ju’s outlook comes as 24% of the 200 largest cryptocurrencies have fallen to their lowest levels in more than a year, sparking speculation about possible market capitulation.

The current downturn may signal an incoming market capitulation, according to Juan Pellicer, senior research analyst at crypto intelligence platform IntoTheBlock.
“The recent market correction, with significant liquidations (especially in assets like Solana) and a drop in total crypto market cap to $3.13 trillion, points toward possible capitulation as overleveraged positions are flushed out,” Pellicer told Cointelegraph.

The hacker behind the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit has laundered more than $335 million in digital assets, with investigators continuing to track the movement of stolen funds.
Crypto investor sentiment was hit by the largest hack in crypto history on Feb. 21, when Bybit lost over $1.4 billion in liquid-staked Ether (STETH), Mantle Staked ETH (mETH) and other digital assets.
Onchain data shows that the hacker has moved 45,900 Ether (ETH) — worth about $113 million — in the past 24 hours, bringing the total amount laundered to more than 135,000 ETH, valued at $335 million.
That left the hacker with about 363,900 ETH, worth around $900 million, according to pseudonymous blockchain analyst EmberCN.

US lawmakers in the House of Representatives have advanced a resolution to repeal the “DeFi broker rule,” which requires brokers to report digital asset transactions to the Internal Revenue Service.
Set to take effect in 2027, the IRS broker regulation was approved on Dec. 5 and would expand existing reporting requirements to include decentralized exchanges. It would require brokers to disclose gross proceeds from sales of cryptocurrencies, including information regarding the taxpayers involved in the transactions.
During its Feb. 26 committee markup, the House Ways and Means Committee, a key group within the House that deals with financial issues, voted 26 to 16 to advance the resolution.

In a statement, Miller Whitehouse-Levine, the CEO of DeFi advocacy group the DeFi Education Fund, said the rule is an “unlawful and unconstitutional overreach” and needed to be overturned to “protect Americans’ freedom of choice in how they transact.”

Ethereum-based cryptocurrency wallet MetaMask is expanding its fiat off-ramp services to support 10 additional blockchain networks. The move, in partnership with payments provider Transak, is aimed at simplifying the process of converting digital assets into traditional currency.
MetaMask users were previously forced to swap assets into Ether (ETH) tokens before being able to convert them into fiat money, adding extra steps and transaction fees.
However, as part of MetaMask’s ongoing partnership with Transak, the wallet will add support to 10 new networks: the Arbitrum mainnet, Avalanche C-Chain mainnet, Base, BNB Chain, Celo, Fantom, Moonbeam, Moonriver, Optimism and Polygon.
The first four tokens to receive immediate off-ramping support include ETH on Ethereum, ETH on Optimisim, BNB (BNB) and the Polygon (POL) token. Support for the additional six networks will be gradually rolled out.
“By expanding off-ramping capabilities with Transak, MetaMask is removing barriers between crypto and traditional currency, allowing users to convert a broader range of tokens directly to cash,” said Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys.
