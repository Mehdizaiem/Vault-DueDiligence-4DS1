Bitcoin (BTC) still risks a crash to $75,000 as BTC price weakness accelerates into the weekly close.
How low can BTC price action go before finding a bottom? Popular market participants weigh in as data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC/USD down over 3% on March 9.
Exchange order books are forming an area of intense interest among Bitcoin traders as the weekly candle close nears.
Liquidation levels on either side of the spot price look ripe for the taking, with longs already paying as BTC/USD sags to $83,000.
“Liquidation map says: Whales hunting stops!” popular trader TheKingfisher wrote in a warning to X followers on the day.

Data from monitoring resource CoinGlass currently puts aggregate 24-hour crypto liquidations at over $300 million.
The thickest bid liquidity across exchanges stood at just below $83,000 at the time of writing, with the spot price dangerously close to breaking lower.

Could February’s multimonth lows of $78,000 be just the start?
A bearish BTC price take suggests that the market is not done retesting levels not seen since November last year.
For popular trader Mikybull Crypto, there is a clear chance that Bitcoin will retest its 50-week simple moving average (SMA).
“$BTC likely heading for the MA support for a potential local bottom,” he predicted.

BTC/USD last interacted with the 50-week SMA in September but has avoided a weekly candle close below it since March 2023.
The 200-day SMA, meanwhile, is also back on the radar as price challenges it as support for the first time since October.

As Cointelegraph reported last week, a historically accurate BTC price mechanism suggests that the real floor now lies at around $69,000.

Only 4% of the global population currently holds Bitcoin (BTC), with the highest concentration of ownership in the United States, where an estimated 14% of individuals own BTC.
According to a research report from River, a BTC financial services company, North America remains the continent with the highest adoption rate among individuals and institutions, while Africa is currently the lowest at only 1.6%.
Overall, BTC adoption tended to be higher in more developed regions than in developing regions. River estimates that BTC has only achieved 3% of its maximum adoption potential — signaling that the digital currency is still in the early stages of global adoption.

The financial services company arrived at the 3% figure by calculating Bitcoin's total addressable market, which includes governments, corporations, and institutions — at only 1%. 
River also took institutional underallocation and individual ownership rates into account to arrive at the 3% metric.
Although Bitcoin has come a long way since its early cypherpunk days, recently becoming a US government reserve asset, several hurdles stand in the way of Bitcoin mass adoption on a global scale.

Bitcoin stands at the intersection of technology and finance — two topics that are dense enough on their own, let alone together.
The biggest problem facing Bitcoin's mass adoption is a lack of financial and technical education, which fuels misconceptions about BTC — including the idea that it is a scam or a Ponzi Scheme.
Digital assets are also notorious for their high volatility — a friend of the short-term trader but the enemy of anyone using BTC as a medium of exchange or a store of value.

High volatility disproportionality affects residents in developing economies, who have turned to US dollar stablecoins as a digital store of value due to their low transaction fees and relative stability compared to other cryptocurrencies.
During the recent White House Crypto Summit on March 7, United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US will use stablecoins to ensure US dollar hegemony and protect its status as the global reserve currency.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

The widespread disappointment surrounding the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — hailed as a historic step for Bitcoin adoption — suggests unrealistic investor expectations, according to regulatory experts.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 7, which will utilize Bitcoin (BTC) seized in government criminal cases rather than purchasing the asset directly from the market. The announcement triggered a more than 6% drop in Bitcoin’s price, falling from $90,400 to $84,979, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro data.
The reaction signals unrealistic industry expectations, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of Fideum, a regulatory and blockchain infrastructure firm focused on institutions.

“It was very clear that the US government could utilize the existing BTC in their possession, aka seized funds,” she told Cointelegraph, adding:
The Bitcoin reserve is a “cautious” approach with taxpayer funds, which “make this decision well aligned with the messaging from this administration,” added the regulatory expert.

Although the current plan does not involve government Bitcoin purchases, the order does not rule them out in the future. The order authorizes the US Treasury and Commerce secretaries to develop “budget-neutral strategies” to buy more Bitcoin for the reserve, provided there are no additional costs to taxpayers.
Still, the short-term investor disappointment paired with ongoing macroeconomic concerns related to import tariffs may push Bitcoin to a weekly close below $82,000, risking more downside volatility, analysts told Cointelegraph.

Trump signed the historic Bitcoin reserve order a day ahead of hosting the first White House Crypto Summit, which also received mixed reactions from the crypto community.
Despite its divided reception, the summit marks a pivotal moment for the White House’s engagement with the crypto industry, according to Alexander Urbelis, general counsel and chief information security officer at Ethereum Name Service.
Urbelis told Cointelegraph:

Bitcoin could face increased downside volatility if it closes the week below the key $82,000 support level as investor sentiment remains subdued following short-term disappointment in the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
President Donald Trump’s executive order, signed on March 7, outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases rather than actively acquiring Bitcoin (BTC) through market purchases.
The lack of direct federal Bitcoin investment has “led to a near-term negative market reaction and a decline in Bitcoin’s price,” according to Bitfinex analysts.
Bitcoin needs to close the week above the key $82,000 support to avoid a further decline due to this short-term investor disappointment, the analysts told Cointelegraph, adding:
“It demonstrates the sensitivity of cryptocurrency markets to government actions and policies,” the analysts added.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin has lacked significant price momentum, trading under the $90,000 psychological mark since March 7, when Trump hosted the first White House Crypto Summit.
Closing the week above the key $82,000 support may signal a shift in Bitcoin sentiment as investors digest the nuances of Trump’s Bitcoin reserve proposition, which may still see the inclusion of “budget-neutral strategies” to buy more Bitcoin.

Beyond crypto-related legislation announcements, Bitcoin price continues to be pressured by macroeconomic developments and global trade concerns, according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo.
Bitcoin’s “short-term movements will be heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors,” the analyst told Cointelegraph:

On the bright side, Bitcoin may be nearing its local bottom based on a key technical indicator, the relative strength index (RSI), which measures whether an asset is oversold or overbought.

Bitcoin’s RSI stood at 28 on the daily chart, signaling that the asset is oversold. Each time Bitcoin’s RSI reached 28 during this current cycle, Bitcoin price would “either bottom or be between -2% to -8% away from a bottom,” popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital wrote in a March 8 X post.

Strategy founder Michael Saylor has proposed that the United States government acquire up to 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply over the next decade for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
“Acquire 5-25% of the Bitcoin network in trust for the nation through consistent, programmatic daily purchases between 2025 and 2035, when 99% of all BTC will have been issued,” Saylor wrote in a document titled “A Digital Assets Strategy to Dominate the 21st Century Global Economy.” 
Saylor presented the document to US President Donald Trump, government executives, and global crypto leaders at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7.
He explained that the government should stick to a “Never sell your Bitcoin” policy, predicting that by 2045, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could generate over $10 trillion annually, and serve as a “perpetual source of prosperity” for Americans.
Up until 2045, Saylor said the Reserve could generate between $16 trillion and $81 trillion for the US Treasury, potentially easing the national debt.

Earlier that day, Trump signed an executive order establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile,” initially funded with cryptocurrency seized in criminal cases.
While it didn’t include an immediate plan to buy more Bitcoin, the order stated that the Treasury and Commerce secretaries would develop “budget-neutral strategies” for acquiring more Bitcoin, ensuring no added costs for taxpayers.
If the US government acquired 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply, it would hold 5.25 million BTC — far more than the 1 million BTC (5% of the supply) that Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed in the Bitcoin Act introduced in July 2024.

3f736f81be92ca52a376ed7a2aa8c204,Cointelegraph,Fed not cutting rates 'at all' in 2025 may trigger a bear market — Analyst,https://cointelegraph.com/news/federal-reserve-rate-cuts-delay-may-trigger-bear-market-analyst," Network economist Timothy Peterson's model suggests Bitcoin could bottom at $57,000 in the next bear market, but he said it’s unlikely as too many investors ""hover over Bitcoin like vultures."" 
Network economist Timothy Peterson warns that if the US Federal Reserve holds off on rate cuts in 2025, it may cause a broader market downturn, potentially dragging Bitcoin back toward $70,000.
“What it needs is a trigger. I think that trigger may be as simple as the Fed not cutting rates at all this year,” Peterson said in a March 8 X post. Peterson’s comment comes just a day after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell reiterated that he's in no hurry to adjust interest rates.
""We do not need to be in a hurry and are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity,” Powell said in a speech in New York on March 7.
Source: Timothy Peterson
Peterson, who is the author of the paper “Metcalfe’s Law as a Model for Bitcoin’s Value,” estimated how low the Nasdaq could fall to predict Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential bottom in “the next bear market.”
Using Peterson’s Nasdaq lowest price forward model, he estimated that once the bear market begins, the Nasdaq would decline 17% over roughly seven months before finding a bottom.
Applying a “1.9” times multiplier to that amount for Bitcoin’s decline, he estimated a 33% decline in Bitcoin, bringing it down to $57,000 from its current price at publication, $86,199, according to CoinMarketCap data.
Source: Timothy Peterson
However, he said Bitcoin likely won’t drop that far, expecting a floor price closer to the low $70,000 range based on historical trends from 2022.
“Traders and opportunists hover over Bitcoin like vultures,” he said, explaining that once the market expects Bitcoin to hit $57,000, “it won’t get there because there are always some investors who step in because the price is ‘low enough.”
“I remember in 2022 when everyone said the bottom would be $12k.  It only went to $16k, 25% higher than expected,” he said before pointing out that the 25% increase from $57,000 is $71,000. 
The last time Bitcoin traded near the $71,000 price level was on Nov. 6, after Donald Trump won the US election, before rallying for a month and reaching $100,000 by Dec. 5.

In January 2025, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes echoed a similar price prediction.
“I am calling for a $70k to $75k correction in BTC a mini financial crisis, and a resumption of money printing that will send us to $250k by the end of the year,” Hayes said in a Jan. 27 X post.
In December 2024, crypto mining firm Blockware Solutions said Bitcoin’s “bear case” for 2025 would be $150,000, assuming the Federal Reserve reverses course on interest rate cuts.

El Salvador acquired 13 Bitcoin (BTC) since March 1, despite International Monetary Fund (IMF) pressure on the country's public sector to stop accumulating the decentralized store of value asset.
According to the El Salvador Bitcoin Office, the country's Bitcoin treasury holds a total of over 6,105 BTC, valued at more than $527 million at current prices.
The Central American country typically acquires BTC at a steady pace of 1 coin every 24 hours. However, on March 3, El Salvador purchased 5 BTC in a single day.
El Salvador struck a deal with the IMF in December 2024 for a $1.4 billion loan from the organization. As part of that deal, the government of El Salvador agreed to rescind the status of BTC as legal tender in the country and scale back public sector involvement with Bitcoin.

Related: How can Bukele still stack Bitcoin after IMF loan agreement?
El Salvador's Congress amended its Bitcoin laws in January 2025 to comply with the IMF loan agreement. Lawmakers repealed the previous version of the law in a 55-2 vote.
Despite the repeal, the government continued stacking Bitcoin, purchasing two BTC in a single day on Feb. 1 and continuing its daily accumulation of the digital currency.
On March 3, the IMF issued a new request pressuring El Salvador to stop accumulating BTC and stipulated that the country could not issue debt or tokenized securities tied to Bitcoin.
President Nayib Bukele responded to the IMF pressure and said that El Salvador will continue buying BTC — characterizing the IMF's continued pressure as ""whining.""

“If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most 'bitcoiners' abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future,"" Bukele emphatically stated.
The government of El Salvador's unapologetic pro-Bitcoin stance caused several major crypto firms to announce that they are relocating to the Central American country.
On Jan. 7, Bitfinex Derivatives announced it was relocating from Seychelles to El Salvador. Stablecoin issuer Tether followed suit on Jan. 13 by announcing it was moving its headquarters to El Salvador.

This caveat was met with disappointment from some Bitcoin maximalists, who hoped the US government would actively purchase additional BTC for the reserve.

The crypto summit also comes as two major bills await congressional approval: the Stablecoin bill and the Market Structure bill, aiming to help lift the regulatory uncertainty around the US crypto industry.
Marszalek said ongoing dialogue with key regulators, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could see “landmark legislation” pass. He added:
The CEO’s comments come a day after Trump signed an executive order on March 7, which outlined a plan to establish a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases rather than actively acquiring Bitcoin (BTC) through market purchases, Cointelegraph reported.
While no direct BTC purchases were announced, the bill added that the US Treasury and Commerce secretaries could make “budget-neutral strategies” to buy more Bitcoin for the reserve, “provided that those strategies impose no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”
Some analysts see the US Bitcoin reserve plan as the first “real step” for Bitcoin’s integration into the global financial system.
“The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained, told Cointelegraph.
