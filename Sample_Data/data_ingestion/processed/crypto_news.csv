9ca0004aa7b4b8c7bff355754e7d393c,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin Core to unilaterally remove controversial OP-Return limit,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-core-unilaterally-remove-controversial-op-return-limit," The change will remove a limit on the amount of arbitrary data that can be added to Bitcoin transactions. 
Bitcoin Core developers have decided to remove a limit on transaction data in the next network upgrade, enabling more data to be included in a more efficient way. 
“Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow any number of these outputs,” read the announcement on GitHub by Bitcoin developer Greg Sanders on May 5. 
The long-standing limit was originally a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. 
The proposal (PR 32359) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of Chaincode Labs. 
OP_RETURN is a special type of Bitcoin (BTC) transaction output that allows storing small amounts of data on the blockchain, popularized during the ordinals inscriptions craze in early 2024.
Unlike regular transaction outputs, OP_RETURN outputs are not spendable and don’t bloat unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).
The original limit is no longer effective as people found ways around it, such as using fake output addresses, which are actually worse for the network, while some mining services were already ignoring the limit, said Sanders.

Benefits of removing the limit include a cleaner UTXO set, or database of spendable outputs, more consistent behavior across the network, and better alignment with how Bitcoin is actually being used, he added. 
Three possible paths were considered: keeping the cap, raising the cap and removing the cap, which was ultimately decided upon after earning “broad, though not perhaps unanimous, support.” 
“Many users find this to be an undesirable change for a number of reasons,” said Bitcoiner Samson Mow on X on May 5. He added that users “can refuse to upgrade and stay on 29.0 or run another implementation” of the network. 
Critics said that the proposal was introduced without a proper consensus process. 
“I think one thing is pretty clear, there is no consensus at the moment on this OP_RETURN issue,” said Ten31 Fund managing partner Marty Bent.
Some also expressed concerns about deprioritizing Bitcoin’s financial utility and raised questions about undisclosed conflicts of interest.

1d849b3deb13ec41d6bc7a91a8efcc2a,Cointelegraph,Florida takes strategic Bitcoin reserve bills off the table,https://cointelegraph.com/news/florida-takes-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-bills-off-the-table," Florida’s House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 have been “indefinitely postponed and withdrawn from consideration.” 
Two Florida crypto bills have been removed from the legislative process in the latest blow to American state-level strategic Bitcoin reserve ambitions. 
Florida’s House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 have been “indefinitely postponed and withdrawn from consideration” on May 3, according to the Florida Senate. 
Florida’s legislative session adjourned on May 2 without the passage of these two bills, which would have advanced legislation to establish a crypto reserve for the state. The Senate and House agreed to extend the session until June 6 to address budget plans. 
Lawmakers passed about 230 bills during the session, dealing with things like prohibiting putting fluoride in the water, protecting state parks, and a school smartphone ban, but diversifying state treasury portfolios was not among them. 
HB 487, which was introduced in February, would have allowed Florida’s chief financial officer and the State Board of Administration to invest up to 10% of certain state funds into Bitcoin (BTC).
SB 550 was also filed in February to enable investments of public funds in Bitcoin.

Florida has now dropped out of the race to pass state-level crypto investment legislation, along with Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana and Oklahoma, which have all seen Bitcoin bills fail to pass House or Senate votes, according to Bitcoin Laws. 
It came just days after Arizona advanced its strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation further than any other state, until House Bill 1025 was vetoed by Governor Katie Hobbs, who labelled digital assets “untested investments” on May 3.
The Digital Assets Strategic Reserve bill would have permitted Arizona to invest seized funds into Bitcoin and create a reserve managed by state officials. 
The move drew the ire of crypto advocates and Bitcoiners, including entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, who said: “Imagine the ignorance of a politician to believe they can make investment decisions.”
“Arizona has two more chances to be the first in the nation to establish a Bitcoin reserve,” said Satoshi Action Fund founder Dennis Porter on May 5, citing an article from Fox’s Eleanor Terrett. 
He added that the most likely to pass is HB 2749, which offers a budget-neutral method to fund the reserve using profit from the unclaimed property fund.
There is also a related bill, SB 1373, which would authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of Arizona state funds into digital assets. It has yet to reach a final vote.

3ee92e6f630a0bffafb6bcbde01e48c8,Cointelegraph,"Price predictions 5/12: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, SUI",https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-predictions-5-12-spx-dxy-btc-eth-xrp-bnb-sol-doge-ada-sui," Bitcoin is witnessing profit booking near its all-time high, but it is likely to find solid support at $100,000. Will altcoins follow? 
Key points:
Bitcoin price saw profit booking near $105,819, signaling that bears remain active at higher levels.
Select altcoins have continued to move higher, indicating increased investor interest.  
The SPX and the DXY are playing catch-up to Bitcoin following the US-China trade deal.
Bitcoin (BTC) has started the new week on a cautious note, falling below $103,000, but the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the US Dollar Index (DXY) have risen sharply following the announcement of the US-China trade agreement. One of the reasons could be that other assets are trying to play catch up with Bitcoin, and the sharp rally in the US dollar may be acting as headwinds for Bitcoin in the near term.
Bitwise European Head of Research André Dragosch said in a post on X that the firm’s proprietary indicator has reached its highest level since 2024. Historically, high levels of the indicator have resulted in a short-term correction or sideways price action.
The short-term uncertainty has not stopped the long-term bulls from adding more Bitcoin to their portfolio. Michael Saylor’s Strategy acquired 13,390 Bitcoin at an average price of $99,856 between May 5 and May 11. The latest purchase has boosted the firm's haul to 568,840 Bitcoin.
What are the crucial support levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
The S&P 500 Index gapped up sharply on May 12 and rose above the stiff overhead resistance at 5,800.
Time is running out for the bears. If they want to prevent the upside, they will have to fiercely defend the 5,800 level and quickly drag the price below the 20-day exponential moving average (5,570). If they manage to do that, the index could start a deeper correction toward 5,400.
Instead, if the price closes above 5,800, the up move may continue toward the 6,000 level. There could be a minor halt at 6,000, but if the bulls prevail, the index could retest the all-time high at 6,147.
The US Dollar Index pierced the 20-day EMA (100.42) on May 8, indicating that the bears are losing their grip.
Sellers tried to pull the price back below the 20-day EMA on May 9, but the bulls held their ground. The index has reached the 50-day simple moving average (102.08), which is expected to behave as a resistance. 
If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA but finds support at the 20-day EMA, it suggests a positive sentiment. That increases the likelihood of a rally to 103.54 and thereafter to 104.68.
Bitcoin has turned down from $105,819, indicating that the bears are defending the $107,000 to $109,588 zone.
The first support on the downside is the $100,000 level, and below that, the 20-day EMA ($97,238). If the price rebounds off the support zone, the bulls will again try to kick the BTC/USDT pair above $109,588. If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $130,000.
Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals that buyers are booking profits at higher levels. That opens the doors for a fall to $93,000 and then to the 50-day SMA ($89,302).
Ether (ETH) bulls are trying to sustain the price above $2,550, but the bears have kept up the selling pressure.
If the price skids below $2,435, the ETH/USDT pair may fall to $2,320. If the price rebounds off $2,320, the bulls will try to resume the up move. There is resistance at $2,850, but if it is crossed, the pair could reach $3,000.
Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $2,320, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may drop to the breakout level of $2,111, which is likely to act as support.
XRP (XRP) broke above the resistance line on May 10, and the bulls successfully held the retest of the breakout level on May 11.
The bulls have strengthened their position by pushing the price above the $2.50 resistance. There is minor resistance at $2.65, but if the level is scaled, the rally could reach $3. Such a move signals a potential trend change.
Alternatively, if the price turns down sharply from $2.65 and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($2.27), it signals a possible range formation in the near term. The XRP/USDT pair could swing between $2 and $2.65 for some time.
BNB (BNB) turned down from $679 on May 10 but rebounded off the breakout level of $644 on May 12.
Buyers tried to resume the up move, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling near the $700 level. If the price stays above $644, the bulls will make another attempt to propel the BNB/USDT pair to $745.
Sellers will have to pull the price below $644 to weaken the bulls. The pair could then fall to the 20-day EMA ($621). Buyers are expected to defend the 20-day EMA because a break below it could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.
Solana’s (SOL) up move has stalled near the $180 resistance, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground to the bears. 
A shallow pullback increases the possibility of the continuation of the rally. If buyers drive the price above $180, the SOL/USDT pair could rally to $210.
The immediate support on the downside is at $168. If the price slides below $168, the pair could descend to the 20-day EMA ($155). A solid rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls remain in control. That increases the likelihood of a break above $180. Sellers will gain the upper hand on a break below $153.

Dogecoin (DOGE) turned down from $0.26 on May 11, indicating profit booking by short-term buyers.
The bulls are expected to aggressively defend the breakout level of $0.21. If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it signals that the bulls have flipped the level into support. The DOGE/USDT pair could then climb to $0.31.
On the contrary, a break and close below the $0.21 level suggests that bears remain active at higher levels. The pair could then drop to the moving averages, pointing to a possible range formation between $0.14 and $0.26 in the near term.
Cardano (ADA) is facing resistance near $0.86, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.
The 20-day EMA ($0.72) has started to turn up, and the RSI is near the overbought area, indicating an advantage to buyers. If the price rebounds off the neckline, the bulls will try to propel the ADA/USDT pair above $0.856. If they can pull it off, the pair could travel to the target objective of $1.01.
If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the moving averages. If they do that, the pair could descend to the solid support at $0.58.
Sui (SUI) is facing selling at $4.25, but a positive sign is that the bulls have maintained the price above the breakout level of $3.90.
Both moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers clear the $4.25 level, the SUI/USDT pair could soar to $5.
The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the $3.90 level. That opens the doors for a fall to the 20-day EMA ($3.48). A bounce off the 20-day EMA signals that the positive momentum remains intact. The bulls will then again try to clear the overhead hurdle at $4.25.

1bdff37865bdc5ee7c2f40da128d4b50,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin price sells off after Trump’s US-China tariff deal — Here is why,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-sells-off-after-trump-s-us-china-tariff-deal-here-is-why," Bitcoin price takes an unexpected turn to the downside even as stocks soar following the US-China trade deal announcement. 
Key takeaways:
Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.
Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. 
Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.
The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under discussion include “currency manipulation,” “steel price dumping,” and restrictions on semiconductor exports.
Part of Bitcoin’s recent lack of momentum can be attributed to its 24% gains over the previous 30 days, during which S&P 500 futures rose 7% and gold remained flat. Investors see little reason for further divergence between Bitcoin and traditional markets, especially since the 30-day correlation with the stock market remains high at 83%. 
Additionally, Bitcoin has now surpassed the market capitalization of both silver and Google, making it the world’s sixth-largest tradable asset.
News that Strategy acquired another 13,390 BTC between May 5 and May 11 has also raised concerns among investors. With BlackRock and Strategy together holding 1.19 million BTC, about 6% of the circulating supply, some traders worry that Michael Saylor’s company is largely responsible for supporting the price.
Critics, such as Peter Schiff, predict that Strategy’s ever-increasing average purchase price could eventually lead to losses and force the company to sell some of its holdings to cover borrowing costs. However, this scenario seems unlikely, as the company has doubled its capital increase limit by $21 billion in stocks and another $21 billion in debt.
While traders often focus on Bitcoin-specific events, the most likely reason for the weakness near $105,000 is broader macroeconomic conditions. Although the pause in tariffs directly benefits the stock market, the effect on scarce assets like Bitcoin is somewhat negative. For example, gold fell 3.4% on May 12 as the demand for safe-haven assets declined.
Gold has typically shown an inverse correlation with the US Dollar Index (DXY), which climbed to its highest level in 30 days on May 12. The strengthening US dollar signals investor confidence, despite a 0.3% decline in US first-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and a 6.1% jump in pending home sales in March compared to the previous month.

The lack of conviction among Bitcoin investors when prices traded near $105,000 is at least partly due to reduced demand for scarce assets, as investors view the stock market as a more immediate and direct beneficiary of the US-China trade deal. Lower import duties suggest higher revenues and potentially improved profit margins for companies.
Given the impressive $2 billion in inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 1 and May 9, the likelihood of a price drop below $100,000 remains low. The steady demand for Bitcoin following a 24% monthly gain points to institutional adoption rather than retail-driven FOMO, which is a very positive sign for the price.

9a579272a97cb851590955eb3d9087ab,Cointelegraph,BlackRock flags quantum computing as risk for Bitcoin ETFs,https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-flags-quantum-computing-as-risk-for-bitcoin-etfs," The asset manager added a detailed overview of quantum computing threats to the risk disclosure in its Bitcoin ETF's regulatory filing. 
Emerging technologies, including quantum computing, could potentially render the cryptography securing Bitcoin and other blockchain networks ineffective, asset manager BlackRock said in a regulatory filing. 
On May 9, BlackRock updated the registration statement for its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). The revised version addressed potential risks to the integrity of the Bitcoin network posed by quantum computing, the filing shows.
“[I]f quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock said. 
It is the first time the asset manager has explicitly flagged this risk in its IBIT disclosures. The IBIT ETF is the largest spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, with approximately $64 billion in net assets, according to its website. 
Quantum computing is an emergent field that seeks to use the principles of quantum mechanics to greatly enhance computers’ processing capabilities.

James Seyffart, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, cautioned that risk disclosures such as IBIT’s are required to highlight every possible risk to an asset, even those that are extremely unlikely. 
“They are going to highlight any potential thing that can go wrong with any product they list or underlying asset that’s being invested in,” Seyffart said in a May 9 X post. “It's completely standard. And honestly [it] makes complete sense.”
Since launching in January, Bitcoin ETFs have collectively attracted more than $41 billion in net inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. 
On May 8, Bitcoin ETF net inflows surpassed all-time highs of around $40 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. 
“Lifetime net flows is #1 most imp metric to watch IMO, very hard to grow, pure truth, no bs,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said in a May 9 X post. “Impressive, they were able to make it to a new high water mark so soon after the world was supposed to end.”
In February, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino predicted that quantum computing would eventually enable hackers to break into inactive Bitcoin wallets and recover the dormant coins. 
“Any Bitcoin in lost wallets, including Satoshi (if not alive), will be hacked and put back in circulation,” Ardoino said in a Feb. 8 X post.

Key takeaways: 
Possible de-risking ahead of the May 13 CPI print could be playing a role in today’s BTC price correction. 
Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.
Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.

As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired 13,390 Bitcoin, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC. 
On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to 600% after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump’s current crypto adviser. The month of April followed a similar trajectory to today, where frequent Bitcoin treasury creation announcements were made by an assortment of US-based and international companies.

While Bitcoin's mass adoption appears to be accelerating, data from Glassnode suggests that BTC price could be in for a brief period of consolidation after gaining 9% in the last week. 
The onchain analytics firm posted the above chart and warned that: 
At major crypto exchanges, there was an uptick in selling in perpetual futures markets, and selling was also seen in spot markets as BTC price rallied into a sell wall near $106,000. 
From a trader's point of view, a portion of the selling could be possible derisking ahead of the May 13 Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report, along with the view that the Trump trade deal with China is now priced in after BTC failed to rally and hold above $104,000 on such momentous news. 
Leading into the trade war news, the US Dollar Index (DXY) rallied and stock indexes soared. Seeing Bitcoin failing to break and hold $104,000 to $105,000 prior to stock futures opening and then BTC being unable to follow equities opening bell gains in the NY session suggests some traders elected to close profitable longs ahead of tomorrow’s CPI or before the current bid appetite shifts to lower price levels. 
This view can be interpreted by the chart above, showing open interest rising hour-over-hour, along with an abrupt spike in the funding rate as short positions opened and longs were liquidated. 
Spot purchasing played a significant role in last week’s Bitcoin price rally, and the May 12 announcement from Strategy and spot BTC ETF inflows of the past 7 days raises more immediate concerns of whether the type of buying appetite seen since late April will spill over into another week. 
Considering the accelerating pace of Bitcoin adoption within traditional finance and the rapidly improving crypto regulatory environment, the current price action appears to be a short-term technical correction. Perhaps, dependent upon tomorrow’s CPI print, spot and margin longs will return in force once the market digests the details of the report.

6b1317538c02f23303dda567676c0a42,Cointelegraph,Will Bitcoin hodlers be the reason more countries adopt wealth taxes?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hodlers-wealth-taxes," As Bitcoin’s value skyrockets, governments may turn to wealth taxes to tap into unrealized gains, raising questions about the future of crypto taxation. 
Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly
Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 
Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.
What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.
Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world’s biggest economies — like the US, Australia and France — have largely steered clear. 
That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (BTC) be labeled “unproductive,” which would mean taxing its gains every year — whether or not it’s ever sold. 
Yep, every asset holder’s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea. 
With Bitcoin’s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood eyeing a $1.5-million price tag by 2030, I’d bet a magic 8-ball would say, “Signs point to yes.”
It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.
The incentive is obvious. Switzerland’s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio’s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.
Countries catch on — sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.
The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985. 
Governments are likely entertaining the idea — whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.
Recent: Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins
In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at $58,000 might have seemed like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table. 
In retrospect, a costly mistake…
Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK’s gold reserves at $275 an ounce? 
Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.
To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money — specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.
Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?
Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn’t worth it. 
Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve — a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.
If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.
One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won’t sit back quietly.

Key points:
Bitcoin seeks consolidation after rapid gains as stocks and the US dollar surge on US-China trade deal news.
Nearby order book liquidity forms potential targets for traders, which now include $102,000.
A classic moving average retest suggests that a new all-time high should result.
Bitcoin (BTC) stuck to $104,000 at the May 12 Wall Street open as markets shifted on US-China trade deal news.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD consolidating after hitting its highest levels since late January.
The US and China agreed to slash reciprocal trade tariffs on the day, causing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index to gain around 3%.
US dollar strength also benefited as a result, with the US dollar index (DXY) hitting one-month highs.
“The last time US tariffs on China were this high, the S&P 500 was ~200 points lower, 4 Fed rate cuts were expected in 2025, and Wall Street was calling for a recession,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of ongoing analysis on X. 
Bitcoin thus adopted the middle ground between major assets on the day as gold dropped precipitously to $3,208 per ounce, nearing month-to-date lows.
“BTC Swept most nearby liquidity above after chopping around the $103K-$105K area for a few days,” popular trader Daan Crypto Trades told X followers alongside a chart of exchange order book liquidity from monitoring resource CoinGlass. 
CoinGlass data showed increasing bids around the $103,000 mark after the Wall Street open.
Continuing, fellow trader CrypNuevo was among those doubling down on a longer-term bull thesis for BTC price action.

BTC/USD, he noted, had conducted a successful retest of the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA).
Currently at $80,300, the 50-week EMA has functioned as a springboard for new all-time highs in recent years.
“We got the 1W50EMA retest and, consequently, the next leg up,” CrypNuevo explained in an X thread on May 11. 
Earlier, Cointelegraph reported on a classic bull market breakout signal on weekly timeframes in the form of a cross on the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator.

a775906bf7b719f9dafd1cf8ca38c11a,Cointelegraph,Trump-linked miner American Bitcoin going public via Gryphon merger,https://cointelegraph.com/news/american-bitcoin-gryphon-merger-public-listing-hut8-trump," Gryphon Digital Mining will acquire American Bitcoin in a stock-for-stock transaction, with the combined entity operating under the American Bitcoin brand. 
Bitcoin mining firm American Bitcoin is going public through a merger with crypto mining company Gryphon Digital Mining, the companies announced on May 12.
Under the terms of the deal, Gryphon Digital Mining will acquire American Bitcoin in a stock-for-stock transaction. After the merger, the new company will operate under the American Bitcoin brand and be led by its board of directors, which includes Eric Trump, the second-eldest of US President Donald Trump’s three sons. News of the merger coincided with a sharp rise in Gryphon Digital Mining’s stock price, which climbed from $0.52 on May 9 to $2.15 at the time of writing, a gain of more than 313%, according to Google Finance.
The announcement follows early April reports that American Bitcoin was considering an initial public offering (IPO).
American Bitcoin is a majority-owned subsidiary of energy infrastructure, crypto mining, and data center firm Hut 8. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said the company aims to make American Bitcoin “a purpose-built vehicle for low-cost Bitcoin accumulation at scale.” He added:

According to the announcement, existing American Bitcoin shareholders will own roughly 98% of the newly formed company. Following the transaction, the new company will control most of the outstanding stock.
Hut 8 will continue to manage American Bitcoin’s infrastructure and operations through long-term commercial agreements. Those deals are expected, according to the announcement, to generate stable, contracted revenue streams for Hut 8’s power and digital infrastructure segments.

Hut 8 acquired a majority stake in American Bitcoin when it was unveiled at the end of March, with backing from several members of Trump's family. The company, formerly known as American Data Center, was founded by a group of investors, including Trump sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.
Following the deal, American Bitcoin took ownership of Hut 8’s Bitcoin mining hardware. The announcement at the time explained that the new firm “aims to become the world’s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve.”

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao expects Bitcoin’s price to top at $500,000 to $1 million during this market cycle.
During an interview with Rug Radio published on May 5, Zhao said that he expects Bitcoin to reach up to one million dollars during this market cycle. He also highlighted the role of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in this rise, saying that the increasing institutionalization of Bitcoin is a good thing for the market:
Zhao explained that the ETFs are “bringing the traditional institution money into crypto” and “most of the money in the US is institutional money.” He said that “Bitcoin is going up because most of the ETFs are Bitcoin-based.”
Founder of Obchakevich Research Alex Obchakevich told Cointelegraph that “70% [of Bitcoin’s growth] is new institutional capital, the rest is just a redistribution of crypto assets.” He highlighted the role of the ETFs in pushing Bitcoin’s price higher:

Zhao also highlighted that governments are increasingly buying Bitcoin as well, which “is really good for the price action.” He added:
The remarks follow multiple countries accumulating Bitcoin. In late April, El Salvador, the world’s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, continued acquiring Bitcoin despite the International Monetary Fund’s comments claiming the opposite. In the seven days leading to April 27, the country acquired 7 BTC worth over $650,000 at the time.
The country’s Bitcoin Office data shows that El Salvador currently holds nearly 6,170 BTC worth almost $580 million. The Kingdom of Bhutan is also accumulating Bitcoin. January reports suggested that a new economic hub in the country plans to set up a strategic cryptocurrency reserve comprising major crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH).

The former Binance CEO also noted that the US “has pivoted 180 degrees under a pro-crypto president,” since the election of President Donald Trump. He said:
Talking about retail investors, he said that they “had 15 years to buy.” Consequently, “if they’re late now, that was their choice.”

478bad19d3852d3adf798d30a2da834c,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin risks sub-$92K retest as BTC price fails to match 4% gold gains,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-faces-91-6-k-retest-btc-price-fails-match-gold-gains," Bitcoin is once more lagging behind relentless gold as the macroeconomic landscape continues to spark surprises — and levels closer to $90,000 may be next. 
Key points:
Bitcoin is struggling again as gold retakes the limelight with week-to-date gains of nearly 5%.
Bitcoin’s correlation with gold is under scrutiny amid ongoing macroeconomic shifts.
Traders see a short-term slump amid a wider BTC price rebound.
Bitcoin (BTC) eyed fresh month-to-date lows into the May 6 Wall Street open as “directionless” crypto markets contrasted with a gold rebound.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price momentum stalling at $95,000 before the latest daily close. 
Inching closer to the key yearly open support level at $93,500, BTC/USD appeared caught in limbo while gold returned to outperform.
XAU/USD was up 1.5% on the day at the time of writing, with week-to-date gains already at 4.4%.
“Crypto implied vols remain suppressed, with front-end skew drifting back toward neutral and spot largely directionless,” trading firm QCP Capital wrote in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers.
QCP noted various swings across the macro spectrum, with the dollar staying lower and emerging market currencies, especially the Taiwanese dollar, surging alongside gold.
“At the same time, the FX shakeup coincides with a nearly 3% surge in gold on Monday, as investors lean into the weaker-dollar narrative and price in geopolitical risk premia, including prospective US trade diplomacy,” it continued.
With Bitcoin yet to follow suit, QCP saw an “increasingly binary” next phase, with one outcome being that BTC “decouples from gold’s safe haven bid and relinks with broader risk proxies.”
In its own analysis, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter nonetheless saw the “first gold, then Bitcoin” narrative sticking.
“In April, Bitcoin joined the gold run, increasing correlation for the first time in months. Between April 7th and April 21st, gold surged +15% along with +12% in Bitcoin,” it observed in an X thread on May 5. 
Examining technical data, Bitcoin traders suggested that BTC/USD may be pausing within a broader comeback.

Evidence for this came from the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator, a measure of trend strength that gave conflicting signals on longer and shorter timeframes.

Popular trader Dave The Wave revealed a bullish signal on the weekly MACD, while daily behavior confirmed a bearish crossing below the zero line.
“BTC is consolidating between last week’s high and low, awaiting tomorrow’s FOMC meeting and Jerome Powell’s speech. Meanwhile, the daily MACD is crossing bearish, signaling slowing momentum,” fellow trader Titan of Crypto summarized.
His post referred to the week’s key macro event, the meeting of the Federal Reserve to decide on interest rate changes, due on May 7.
Earlier, Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, warned that the yearly open was unlikely to hold as support.
“To summarize, I'll be pleasantly surprised if the YO holds,” he told X followers.

26a745fd3eabfd39faa752424ca20c77,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin price forms two BTC futures gaps after Coinbase premium flips negative,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-btc-futures-gaps-after-coinbase-premium-turns-negative," Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium drops below zero, signaling a bearish sentiment and potential volatility amid CME gaps on both sides of the market. 
Key takeaways: 
Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index turned negative for the first time in 15 days, indicating defensive short-term sentiment among US investors.
Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 
Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.
Cointelegraph reported early signs of selling pressure, with Bitcoin recording over $300 million in negative spot cumulative volume delta (CVD) from April 27 to April 29, indicating sustained sell-side activity.

This selling pressure persisted over the weekend, contributing to the price decline, with anonymous crypto analyst Exitpump noting that Bitfinex whales exhibited significant selling pressure compared to Coinbase and Binance. 
Additionally, approximately 8,000 BTC in open interest (OI) was removed across futures markets, reflecting reduced leverage. However, recent data shows that the aggregated futures bid-ask delta is turning positive, suggesting potential buying interest in derivatives markets.
Bitcoin is at a pivotal juncture, trading around $94,000 between two CME futures gaps. The gaps are between $92,000 and $92,500 from two weeks ago and $96,400 and $97,400 from the recent weekend. CME gaps often act as magnets for price action, with historical trends showing a tendency to fill these gaps in a matter of days. 
Bitcoin is expected to test at least one gap this week, with a potential drop to $92,000 more likely after Bitcoin failed to hold its position above its 200-day simple moving average (blue line). 
Bitcoin has lost its position above the 200-day SMA for the first time since April 11, possibly indicating a trend shift in the lower time frame (LTF) chart.
However, choppy price action is likely in the short term due to overhead resistance at $97,000-$98,000 (CME gap 1) and key support at $93,000, where multiple liquidity levels are present. 
Crypto trader UB pointed out several key areas of interest to watch for on X, saying:

fa625bb1dd9fa9eb417797dbbcafdae6,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin sell-off to $93.5K is a brief hiccup — Data still supports new BTC highs in 2025,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-sell-off-to-93-5-k-is-a-brief-hiccup-data-still-supports-new-btc-highs-in-2025," Bitcoin price opened the week with a correction, but strong interest from institutional investors keeps the $100,000 target within reasonable reach. 
Key takeaways:
Bitcoin price slips, but BTC dominance is on the rise.
Sizable purchases by Strategy and the spot BTC ETFs highlight institutional investors’ appetite for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has dropped by 4.3% in the last three days after nearly reaching $97,900 on May 2. Despite showing resilience at the $94,000 level on May 5, some traders are disappointed that strong institutional inflows have not been enough to maintain bullish momentum. However, several encouraging signs suggest that a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2025 remains within reach.
Bitcoin’s dominance over the broader cryptocurrency market has surged, currently standing at 70%, its highest since January 2021. This has occurred despite a wave of new token launches, including several top-50 projects such as SUI, Toncoin (TON), PI, Official Trump (TRUMP), Bittensor (TAO), Ethena (ENA), and Celestia (TIA). This dominance makes riskier altcoins less appealing to new market entrants.
The spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $4.5 billion in net inflows between April 22 and May 2. At the same time, the increasing appetite for Bitcoin futures signals growing institutional adoption regardless of whether leverage is used for downside protection or bullish bets.
According to CoinGlass, the total open interest in Bitcoin futures markets has reached 669,090 BTC, a 21% increase since March 5. Even after Bitcoin’s price crashed below $75,000 in early April, demand for leveraged positions remained strong. The open interest in BTC futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) alone exceeds $13.5 billion, indicating robust institutional demand.
Several factors explain why Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim the $100,000 level. Traders who bought in anticipation of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill on March 6 are growing increasingly frustrated, as the government has yet to disclose its BTC holdings or announce plans for further purchases. Additionally, similar state-level Bitcoin bills have repeatedly failed, including the latest setback in the US state of Arizona.
Over the past three months, gold has outperformed most assets, rising 16%, while Bitcoin has declined by 5% and the S&P 500 has corrected by 6.5%. This has challenged the notion of Bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset, as the cryptocurrency has repeatedly failed to decouple from the S&P 500 amid rising economic risks. The global trade war has led investors to favor fixed-income assets and cash positions.
Bitcoin’s recent drop to $94,000 is particularly concerning given that Strategy, a US-listed company led by Michael Saylor, announced the acquisition of 1,895 BTC on May 5, after doubling its capital increase plan to fund further Bitcoin purchases. However, since investors were previously uncertain about Strategy’s ability to raise additional capital, the announcement of an $84 billion plan on May 1 has reduced some of this risk.
For Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high, investors will likely need reassurance that US-China trade relations are improving, as tariffs have negatively impacted overall risk appetite. Nevertheless, the key elements for a BTC bull run above $100,000 appear to be in place.

Key points:
Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.
Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 
Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.
Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 
Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that there were more than $9 in realized profits for every dollar realized in loss.
However, a positive sign in favor of bulls is that the US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds witnessed inflows of $1.8 billion last week, per Farside Investors data. The ETF issuers and the institutions acquired 18,644 Bitcoin last week compared to the 3,150 Bitcoin mined during the period, reported asset allocator HODL15Capital on May 4.
What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its recovery last week and rose above the 50-day simple moving average (5,575).
The 20-day exponential moving average (5,501) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, indicating advantage to buyers. The up move could reach 5,800, which is expected to attract strong selling by the bears. If the price turns down from 5,800, it is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA. 
Sellers will have to yank the price below the 20-day EMA to suggest that the bullish momentum is weakening. The index may drop to 5,400 and subsequently to 5,300.
The US Dollar Index (DXY) bounced off the 99 support on April 29 and reached the 20-day EMA (100.38) on May 1.
Buyers are facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA, but a minor positive is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That improves the prospects of a break above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the index could rise to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of 101.39 and then to the 50-day SMA (102.72).
This positive view will be invalidated if the price continues lower and breaks below the 99 level. That could sink the index to the critical support at 97.92.
Bitcoin closed below the $95,000 support on May 4, and the bears are trying to extend the pullback to the 20-day EMA ($92,204).
Buyers will have to fiercely defend the 20-day EMA to keep the bullish momentum intact. If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to propel the BTC/USDT pair to the psychological level of $100,000. 
Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals the bulls are rushing to the exit. That may sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($86,890). A deeper pullback suggests a range formation in the near term.
Buyers have managed to sustain Ether (ETH) above the moving averages, signaling strength.
The 20-day EMA ($1,771) is sloping up gradually, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. There is minor resistance at $1,957, but it is likely to be crossed. The ETH/USDT pair could surge to the breakdown level of $2,111, where the bears are expected to sell aggressively.
A break and close below the moving averages opens the gates for a fall to $1,537 and later to the critical support at $1,368.
XRP (XRP) remains stuck between the resistance line and the $2 support, indicating buying on dips and selling on rallies.
Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. This equilibrium will tilt in favor of the bulls if they drive the price above the resistance line. The XRP/USDT pair could soar to $3, suggesting a short-term trend change.
On the contrary, a break and close below $2 will put the sellers in charge. The pair may then retest the vital support at $1.61, where the buyers are expected to step in.
BNB (BNB) slipped below the moving averages on May 4, but the bears are struggling to sustain the lower levels.
If buyers push the price above the moving averages, it suggests buying at lower levels. The bulls will then attempt to overcome the barrier at $620. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could shoot up to $644.
Alternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages, it suggests that the bears are trying to take control. There is support in the $576 to $566 zone, but if it breaks down, the pair could dive to $520.
Solana (SOL) is finding support at the 20-day EMA ($143), indicating that the bulls remain buyers on dips.
The bulls will again attempt to thrust the price above the $153 resistance. If they manage to do that, the SOL/USDT pair could ascend to $180. Such a move brings the large $110 to $260 range into play.
If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to swiftly pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair could descend to the 50-day SMA ($133). That suggests the pair may consolidate between $110 and $153 for a while.

Buyers have managed to keep Dogecoin (DOGE) above the moving averages but failed to start a strong rebound.
The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest the DOGE/USDT pair may extend its stay inside the $0.21 to $0.14 range for some time.
If the price turns up from the moving averages, the bulls will try to push the pair to $0.21. Sellers are expected to defend the level aggressively, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could skyrocket to $0.28. Contrarily, a break below the moving averages could sink the pair to the solid support at $0.14.
Cardano (ADA) is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the moving averages.
The flattish moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above $0.75. That opens the doors for a rally to $0.83.
On the downside, a close below the moving averages tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. There is solid support at $0.58, but if the level gives way, the ADA/USDT pair could plunge to $0.50.
Sui (SUI) is attempting to bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.09), indicating demand at lower levels.
The bulls will try to push the price to $3.90, which is expected to act as a stiff resistance. However, the upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that buyers have an edge. A break and close above $3.90 could catapult the SUI/USDT pair to $4.25 and later to $5.
Instead, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals that the bulls have given up. That may pull the price to $2.86 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.57).

a692bb73f625f20896b0ecc2a045c1aa,Cointelegraph,Can you stake Bitcoin (BTC)? Here’s what you need to know,https://cointelegraph.com/news/can-you-stake-bitcoin-btc," Earn yield on Bitcoin using centralized lending platforms, through Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, or Bitcoin layer-2 platforms. 
Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.
WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.
Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.
Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.
Unlike proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum or Cardano, Bitcoin relies on proof-of-work (PoW) mining for network security. However, with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and layer-2 innovations, Bitcoin (BTC) holders can now generate passive income through various yield-generating methods. These include centralized lending, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks.
This article explores how to earn yield on BTC, the risks involved and the technological advancements enabling these opportunities, all without altering Bitcoin’s core protocol.
Staking and mining are two distinct consensus mechanisms used to secure blockchain networks and validate transactions. 
Staking is central to PoS blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. Participants lock up cryptocurrency to become validators, who are randomly selected to create new blocks and confirm transactions, earning rewards. The more coins staked, the higher the chance of selection.
Mining, used by PoW blockchains like Bitcoin and Litecoin, involves miners solving complex mathematical puzzles with powerful computers. The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and receives a reward. Mining demands significant energy and hardware.
Bitcoin’s PoW design means it does not support staking. The network relies entirely on miners to ensure decentralization and security. There are no validators or staking rewards in the traditional sense. Yield-generating methods for BTC, such as lending or layer-2 solutions, are not equivalent to PoS staking.
Did you know? Some staking platforms offer liquid staking, where you get a token representing your staked asset (like stETH for Ether). This lets you earn staking rewards and still use your capital in DeFi protocols.
While you cannot natively stake BTC due to its PoW mechanism, there are alternative methods to help you earn yield on your BTC holdings and make passive income. These methods often involve using third-party platforms or bridging BTC to other blockchains.
Centralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure. The collapse of firms like Celsius and BlockFi has highlighted this vulnerability. 
WBTC is an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 by BTC, held by a centralized custodian (BitGo). It enables BTC holders to engage in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, such as lending on Aave, providing liquidity on Curve or yield farming. This unlocks DeFi’s potential but introduces risks from BitGo’s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs.
Emerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin’s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely.
Did you know? Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after “the Merge,” replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain’s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks.
Earning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term.
Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options:
Simple Earn: Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products.
Dual Investment: Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility.
On-chain Yield: Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance.
Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates.
After subscribing:
Simple Earn: BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term’s end.
Dual Investment: Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset.
On-chain Yield: Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts. Withdrawals may face delays due to liquidity or network issues.
Rewards depend on the platform, BTC amount and program terms.
WBTC allows BTC holders to earn yield on Ethereum’s DeFi platforms, such as Aave or Curve, by depositing WBTC into liquidity pools and earning interest or fees.
Steps to earn yield with WBTC, using Curve as an example:
Convert BTC to WBTC: Use a centralized exchange (CEX) (e.g., Binance) or decentralized bridge (e.g., RenBridge) to convert BTC to WBTC, custodied by BitGo.
Transfer WBTC to a wallet: Move WBTC to a Web3 wallet like MetaMask and make sure you have enough Ether (ETH) for gas fees.
Connect to a DeFi protocol: Visit Curve.fi and deposit WBTC into a liquidity pool via the platform’s interface.
Earn yield: By providing liquidity, you earn interest or fees based on pool performance.
Layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks enable yield generation by leveraging Bitcoin’s security. Babylon, for example, locks BTC as collateral to secure its PoS network, connecting to Cosmos zones (interconnected blockchains). Babylon’s Genesis mainnet launched on April 10, 2025, with over 57,000 BTC staked, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.
Steps to earn yield with Babylon:
Set up a compatible wallet: Use a wallet like OKX or Phantom, supporting Native SegWit (bc1q) or Taproot (bc1p) addresses. Avoid wallets with Bitcoin Inscriptions (Ordinals).
Access the Babylon stake app: Visit the Babylon Stake app, which is active post-Genesis launch.
Connect your wallet: Link your BTC wallet and approve digital signature requests for platform interaction.
Choose a finality provider: Select from over 250 finality providers (e.g., Galaxy, Figment) that secure Babylon’s network.
Set transaction fees: Choose default or custom fees (higher fees ensure faster confirmation) and enter the BTC amount to lock.
Confirm and monitor: Lock BTC via the app and track status in the Babylon Staking Terminal. Rewards include BABY tokens, split 50-50 between BTC and BABY stakers.
Did you know? In some countries, crypto yield rewards are taxed as income upon receipt and as capital gains when sold. Tax treatment varies, so consult a professional.
Layer-2 protocols enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality. Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin’s security.
Babylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains.
Stacking is Stacks’ yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks (STX) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.
Coinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns for institutional investors outside the US. 
The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between spot and futures markets, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling. 
Targeting annual net returns of 4–8% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin — an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.
Generating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:
Custodial risk: Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC’s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.
Smart contract risk: WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.
Liquidity risk: Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.
Network maturity: Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.
Market risk: Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.
Regulatory risk: Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction. 
Bitcoin’s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin’s censorship resistance. 
However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin’s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.

b9fb755866f13d83cf97b3ce436ff332,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, altcoins poised to rally on US-China tariff agreement",https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-china-tariff-truce-crypto-market-rally," The constructive tone of tariff negotiations removes the risks of “sudden re-escalation,” potentially paving the way for risk assets to surpass their January peaks, analysts said. 
A 90-day tariff agreement between the US and China may set the stage for a broader recovery of stock and cryptocurrency markets, as investors look ahead to a potential tax relief package.
The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  
Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  
“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”

The constructive tone of the negotiations, along with the 90-day suspension of additional tariffs, removes the risk of “sudden re-escalation,” which may help altcoins and traditional stock markets follow Bitcoin’s (BTC) price recovery, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen.
“Bitcoin is already trading close to its all-time highs,” Barthere told Cointelegraph. “However, with the latest easing in trade tensions, it now appears that altcoins, US equities, and the US Dollar Index (DXY) are well-positioned for a catch-up rally.”
She noted that Bitcoin has outperformed risk assets in recent months due to its insulation from tariff-related risks.
“I also expect the US dollar to perform strongly against prior safe-haven currencies such as the euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen, reflecting improved global risk sentiment,” Barthere added.
Nansen previously predicted a 70% chance for crypto and stocks to find their bottom by June, with their price recovery depending on the outcome of trade negotiations.

Bitcoin is currently 4.8% away from recapturing its all-time high of over $109,800 recorded in January 2025, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
“There is potential for risk assets to move beyond the January peak levels if we see a generous tax cut package materialize,” Barthere told Cointelegraph, adding:
She noted that Bessent hinted such a package could be unveiled by mid-July, which would act as a “significant additional catalyst” for the markets.  
The constructive trade negotiations, paired with emerging technical chart patterns, have spurred analyst calls for a Bitcoin rally to $150,000, depending on the outcome of an emerging bull flag pattern on the weekly chart.
