Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed erratic moves on Bitcoin’s lower timeframes as the daily high near $84,700 evaporated as BTC price dropped by $2,500 at the start of the US trading session.
Fears over a prolonged US trade war and subsequent recession fueled market downside, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index both falling another 3.5% after the open.

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

e33f43bff6d73a0907a42ea081706b62,Cointelegraph,American Bitcoin’s ambition is to dominate mining — Hut 8 CEO,https://cointelegraph.com/news/inside-the-trump-linked-american-bitcoin-mining-ambitions-to-dominate-the-industry-hut-8-ceo," In an exclusive interview, Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot reveals how the Trump-backed American Bitcoin venture is aiming to dominate US mining and ultimately take its vision public. 
Earlier this week, Bitcoin mining giant Hut 8 revealed a partnership that includes two members of the Trump family — Donald Jr. and Eric — and its plans to launch a new mining venture, American Bitcoin. 
In an exclusive interview on Decentralize with Cointelegraph’s Byte-Sized Insight series, Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot shared new details about the venture’s vision, why the timing was right and how the company plans to scale.
“We’ve thought about splitting out our Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure businesses for some time,” Genoot said. “Meeting Eric and Don Jr., and seeing their deep passion for Bitcoin and infrastructure, was the perfect catalyst.”
According to Genoot, the goal is clear: to build one of the world’s largest and most efficient Bitcoin mining platforms, rooted in American soil and aligned with pro-Bitcoin sentiment growing under President Donald  Trump’s administration. “Eric told me, ‘I don’t want to get involved in anything that isn’t the biggest and the best,’” he said.
The move comes at a pivotal moment for US-based mining. With China out of the picture post-2021 crackdown, and Washington now openly exploring the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, America’s place in the global mining ecosystem is under transformation.
Still, size isn’t everything. Genoot emphasized that efficiency and cost-effectiveness are core to the strategy.
Related: Bitcoin miner Hut 8 argues to toss ‘short and distort’ shareholder suit
American Bitcoin’s structure allows it to mine BTC at low cost, accumulate more when the market allows, and potentially expand into other Bitcoin ecosystem services. Hut 8 currently holds over 10,000 BTC on its balance sheet, worth up to $1 billion depending on market conditions. American Bitcoin aims to surpass that.
And the company isn’t just bullish on Bitcoin; it’s bullish on power consumption. Genoot pushed back on criticism that mining wastes energy: 
Looking ahead, Hut 8’s mining spinoff has big ambitions. “Our focus is scaling. Our focus is taking this company public on a US exchange,” Genoot said. “You’ll hear more from us soon.”

aecdd3ca70736675c58ff180b8fa61f5,Cointelegraph,Has Michael Saylor’s Strategy built a house of cards?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-strategy-house-of-cards," Has Saylor pushed Strategy too far? With MSTR at the center of clashing leveraged ETFs and convertible stock plays, the market is making its own bets. 
Strategy Inc, formerly MicroStrategy, has discarded its core product, assumed a new identity, swallowed over half a million Bitcoin, spawned equity classes with double-digit yields, and inspired an arsenal of leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — a unique and significant market phenomenon.
Michael Saylor’s firm has constructed a comprehensive financial framework based around Bitcoin (BTC), tying its corporate performance directly to the cryptocurrency’s price fluctuations. As a result, Strategy’s common stock has evolved into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure, its preferred shares offer yields tied to cryptocurrency risk, and a series of leveraged and inverse ETFs now track its equity movements, all fundamentally connected to its substantial Bitcoin holdings.
Recently, there was an announcement of another purchase by MSTR (Strategy’s common equity) of close to $2 billion of BTC in one clip, inviting even more raised eyebrows and caution.
This concern is not merely because of Strategy’s bet on Bitcoin but the market architecture that has grown around it. A parallel financial ecosystem has emerged, binding its fate to a risk asset that, as Saylor himself notes, trades 24/7. He’s championed the idea that “volatility is vitality,” suggesting that this constant motion draws attention, sustains interest, and breathes life into the entire “Strategyverse” and its related equities.
To some, this is financial innovation in its purest form: bold, unhedged and transformative. To others, it is a fragile lattice of conviction and leverage, one black swan away from unraveling.
MicroStrategy, once a staid business intelligence software provider, has been reborn as Strategy Inc, a corporate avatar synonymous with Bitcoin. The company has made an unabashed leap from offering data analytics to becoming a full-throttle Bitcoin acquisition vehicle.
The numbers speak for themselves. As of March 30, Strategy holds 528,185 BTC, acquired for approximately $35.63 billion at an average price of about $67,458 per Bitcoin. The most recent tranche of BTC in 2025 involved the acquisition of 22,048 BTC for around $1.92 billion, at an average of roughly $86,969 per coin. Year-to-date, Strategy has achieved a BTC yield of 11.0%.
This shift has transformed MSTR into a proxy Bitcoin ETF of sorts, albeit with operational leverage and corporate risk baked in. But unlike the US Securities and Exchange Commission-blessed spot ETFs, MSTR offers amplified exposure: It behaves like Bitcoin, only more so due to the company’s use of leverage and financial engineering.

Now, with the introduction of STRK (8% yield) and STRF (10% yield), Strategy has expanded its reach. These preferred shares offer fixed-income-style returns, but their performance is deeply tethered to Bitcoin’s fate. When Bitcoin surges, yield-bearing holders cheer. They’re still promised yield when it falls, but their capital risk climbs.
Financial innovation? Yes. Structural risk? Most certainly.
Market performance of Strategy-adjacent equities (Base = 100). Source: TradingView
When indexed to 100 at the start of 2025, the performance of Strategy and related instruments demonstrates the effects of volatility and leverage in the Bitcoin-correlated financial ecosystem. As of early April 2025, MSTR has declined moderately by approximately 8%, tracking the broader downward trajectory of Bitcoin itself, which is down around 16%.
The company’s preferred shares, STRF and STRK, have slightly appreciated above their initial indexed values, reflecting investor preference for dividend stability amid market volatility.
MSTU and MSTX have markedly underperformed, dropping around 37%–38% from their normalized starting points due to volatility drag and compounding losses inherent in leveraged daily reset structures.
This YTD snapshot underscores how leverage magnifies returns and the potential risks associated with short-term market movements.
Strategy’s operating income, still derived from its legacy software business, now plays second fiddle to its crypto balance sheet.
However, the firm hasn’t just stockpiled coins; it has created a latticework of financial instruments that reflect and refract BTC price action. MSTR is no longer merely equity; it has become a high-beta Bitcoin play. STRK and STRF are yield-bearing hybrids, offering fixed returns yet functioning like risk instruments in a crypto-linked treasury experiment.
The structural concern is this: By tying every new yield product, equity issuance and debt vehicle to Bitcoin, Strategy has effectively replaced diversification with correlation. Critics argue there is no hedge here, only degrees of bullishness.
This raises the concern that a company can maintain corporate solvency and investor trust when its financial ecosystem is built atop the volatility of a single, historically unstable asset.
Where there is heat, there will be leverage. The market has responded to Strategy’s gravitational pull by creating a suite of leveraged and inverse products tied to MSTR, giving retail and institutional players access to turbocharged Bitcoin exposure without holding the asset directly.
Investors seeking amplified returns in anticipation of price gains can deploy strategies such as MSTU (T Rex) or MSTX (Defiance), both offering 2x long daily returns, or MST3.L, which provides 3x long exposure listed in London.
Conversely, investors expecting price declines might choose SMST, offering 2x short exposure, or MSTS.L and 3SMI, each providing 3x short exposure listed in London.
These instruments are typically employed by traders looking for short-term directional bets and should be handled cautiously due to daily reset mechanics and volatility risks.
These are not traditional ETFs. They are complex, synthetic instruments with daily reset mechanisms and inherent decay risks. Volatility drag ensures that even in a sideways market, leveraged longs underperform. For shorts, the risk of a short squeeze, particularly in parabolic bull runs, is ever-present.
Related: Trade war puts Bitcoin’s status as safe-haven asset in doubt
In practical terms, these products allow traders to speculate on MSTR’s price with minimal capital outlay. But they also amplify misalignment. A trader betting on Bitcoin’s month-long trend might find that their 3x long MSTR ETF underperforms expectations due to compounding losses on down days.
The strategic risk here lies in mismatch: Retail investors may perceive these ETFs as direct Bitcoin exposure with leverage. In reality, they are trading a proxy of a proxy, subject to corporate news, dilution and macro shifts.

Between 2020 and 2025, Strategy has executed over a dozen capital raises via convertible notes, ATM equity programs and, most recently, the STRF preferred offering priced at a 10% yield. The March 2025 raise helped fund the latest $1.92-billion Bitcoin buy.
It is not just about buying Bitcoin. It is about the market constructing a meta-structure where every market instrument, common stock, preferred shares and synthetic ETFs feeds into the same gravitational pull. Each capital raise buys more Bitcoin. Each purchase pushes up sentiment. Each ETF amplifies exposure. This feedback loop has become the hallmark of Strategy’s financial architecture.
With each new issuance, however, dilution risk grows. STRK and STRF investors depend not only on Strategy’s solvency but also on Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation. If BTC stumbles into a prolonged bear market, can those 10% yields continue? 
For investors, Strategy’s approach presents clear opportunities and risks. It offers a streamlined pathway for gaining exposure to Bitcoin through familiar financial instruments, combining elements of equity, fixed income and derivatives. At the same time, investors must carefully consider the volatility of Bitcoin itself, the potential impacts of dilution from continuous capital raises, and the overall health of Strategy’s balance sheet.
Ultimately, the investment outcome will heavily depend on the trajectory of cryptocurrency markets, Strategy’s financial management and evolving regulatory landscapes.

f262033bd0add398caba0db7ca2433e3,Cointelegraph,Trump tariffs squeeze already struggling Bitcoin miners — Braiins exec,https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-tariffs-bitcoin-mining-impact," “It will take a decade for the US to catch up with cutting-edge chip manufacturing,” Braiins chief marketing officer Kristian Csepcsar said. 
The new trade tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump may place added pressure on the Bitcoin mining ecosystem both domestically and globally, according to one industry executive.
While the US is home to Bitcoin (BTC) mining manufacturing firms such as Auradine, it’s still “not possible to make the whole supply chain, including materials, US-based,” Kristian Csepcsar, chief marketing officer at BTC mining tech provider Braiins, told Cointelegraph.
On April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs, imposing a 10% tariff on all countries that export to the US and introducing “reciprocal” levies targeting America’s key trading partners.
Community members have debated the potential effects of the tariffs on Bitcoin, with some saying their impact has been overstated, while others see them as a significant threat.
Csepcsar said the mining industry is already experiencing tough times, pointing to key indicators like the BTC hashprice.
Hashprice — a measure of a miner’s daily revenue per unit of hash power spent to mine BTC blocks — has been on the decline since 2022 and dropped to all-time lows of $50 for the first time in 2024.
According to data from Bitbo, the BTC hashprice was still hovering around all-time low levels of $53 on March 30.

“Hashprice is the key metric miners follow to understand their bottom line. It is how many dollars one terahash makes a day. A key profitability metric, and it is at all-time lows, ever,” Csepcsar said.
He added that mining equipment tariffs were already increasing under the Biden administration in 2024, and cited comments from Summer Meng, general manager at Chinese crypto mining supplier Bitmars.
Source: Summer Meng
“But they keep getting stricter under Trump,” Csepcsar added, referring to companies such as the China-based Bitmain — the world’s largest ASIC manufacturer —  which is subject to the new tariffs.
Trump’s latest measures include a 34% additional tariff on top of an existing 20% levy for Chinese mining imports. In response, China reportedly imposed its own retaliatory tariffs on April 4.
Csepcsar also noted that cutting-edge chips for crypto mining are currently massively produced in countries like Taiwan and South Korea, which were hit by new 32% and 25% tariffs, respectively.
“It will take a decade for the US to catch up with cutting-edge chip manufacturing. So again, companies, including American ones, lose in the short term,” he said.

Csepcsar also observed that some countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States region, including Russia and Kazakhstan, have been beefing up mining efforts and could potentially overtake the US in hashrate dominance.

“If we continue to see trade war, these regions with low tariffs and more favorable mining conditions can see a major boom,” Csepcsar warned.
As the newly announced tariffs potentially hurt Bitcoin mining both globally and in the US, it may become more difficult for Trump to keep his promise of making the US the global mining leader.
Trump’s stance on crypto has shifted multiple times over the years. As his administration embraces a more pro-crypto agenda, it remains to be seen how the latest economic policies will impact his long-term strategy for digital assets.

b4f1c4a87f5a85ff7314d2cece130b9c,Cointelegraph,Malta regulator fines OKX crypto exchange $1.2M for past AML breaches,https://cointelegraph.com/news/malta-fines-okx-crypto-exchange-1-2-million-aml-breaches," MiCA-licensed OKX has significantly improved compliance in the past 18 months, but the Maltese regulator said it could not ignore its past failures. 
Update (April 4, 1:45 pm UTC: This article has been updated to add a comment from an OKX spokesperson.
Cryptocurrency exchange OKX is under regulatory scrutiny in Europe after Maltese authorities issued a fine for violations of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in the past.
Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) fined Okcoin Europe — OKX’s Europe-based arm — 1.1 million euros ($1.2 million) after detecting multiple AML failures on the platform in 2023, the authority announced on April 3.
While admitting that OKX has significantly improved its AML policies in the past 18 months, the authority “could not ignore” its compliance failures from 2023, “some of which were deemed to be serious and systematic,” the FIAU said.
OKX was among the first crypto exchanges to receive a license under Europe’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation via its Malta hub in January 2025.
The FIAU stated that at the time of the compliance examination in 2023, OKX compiled a business risk assessment (BRA) in an attempt to identify threats and vulnerabilities.
The regulators found multiple deficiencies within the BRA’s methodology, making OKX unable to properly access the money laundering risks it was exposed to and to take necessary measures to manage them, it said.
Some of those risks included potential threats from the use of cryptocurrency mixers or tumblers, privacy coins, stablecoins and the usage of tokens on decentralized exchanges.

The FIAU statement also mentioned money laundering risks associated with Okcoin Europe’s exposure to other jurisdictions despite its pledge to only service European customers. It stated:
A spokesperson for OKX did not respond to Cointelegraph’s request to comment on whether the exchange admitted to such wrongdoing in the past.
“With this chapter behind us, OKX remains focused on the future — continuing to build a secure, transparent, and compliant platform for our users worldwide,” the representative said.
The news on the $1.2 million penalty in Malta came soon after Bloomberg in March reported that European Union regulators were probing OKX over its potential role in facilitating the laundering of $100 million in funds from the Bybit hack.
Bybit CEO Ben Zhou previously claimed that OKX’s Web3 proxy allowed hackers to launder roughly $100 million, or 40,233 Ether (ETH), from the $1.5 billion hack, which occurred in February 2025.

In response to Zhou’s allegations, OKX denied claims that there were any ongoing investigations by the EU authorities, adding that “Bybit’s statements are spreading misinformation.”
Source: OKX
The latest news from Malta’s FIAU also followed recent reports suggesting that OKX hired former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to advise it over the federal criminal investigation leading to its plea and a $505 million penalty payment in the US.
OKX’s new penalty in Malta sets a precedent in the context of regulators dealing with past compliance violations by MiCA-licensed companies, showing that the license does not spare the firms from responsibility for past breaches.

Authorities in the US state of Massachusetts continue targeting unlawful cryptocurrency market practices, with a local court fining crypto financial services firm CLS Global.
A federal court in Boston on April 2 sentenced CLS Global on criminal charges related to fraudulent manipulation of crypto trading volume, according to an announcement from the Massachusetts US Attorney’s Office.
In addition to a $428,059 fine, the court prohibited CLS Global from offering services in the US for a probation period of three years.
CLS Global, a crypto market maker registered in the United Arab Emirates, in January pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit market manipulation and one count of wire fraud.
The charges against CLS Global followed an undercover law enforcement operation involving NexFundAI, a token created by the FBI as part of a sting operation in May 2024.
CLS Global was among at least three firms that took the FBI’s bait and agreed to provide “market maker services” for NexFundAI, including a fraudulent scheme to attract investors to purchase the token.
In October 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced fraud charges against CLS and its employee, Andrey Zhorzhes. The US securities regulator also filed complaints against two other NexFundAI manipulators, Hong Kong-linked ZM Quant Investment and Russia-linked Gotbit Consulting.
According to CLS Global CEO Filipp Veselov, the company was founded in 2017 to fill in a “huge gap in the market for high-quality market-making solutions and trading consulting.”
Prior to CLS, Veselov worked at the Russian cryptocurrency exchange platform Latoken, which is advertised as a “global digital asset exchange” and has about 370,000 followers on X.
The CLS team also includes chief revenue officer Pavel Singaevskii, who previously served as sales manager at Stex, a crypto platform that reportedly ceased operations without warning in 2023.

According to CLS Global’s X page, the platform continues operating and has more than 110,000 followers at the time of publication.
Wash trading is an illegal practice involving artificially inflating trading volume by repeatedly buying and selling the same asset, generating a misleading perception of demand.
According to a January 2025 report by the US blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the crypto market has at least $2.6 billion in estimated wash traded volumes, or just about 2% of total daily crypto trading volumes, as reported by CoinGecko.

Some studies indicate that wash trading makes up a bigger share of the crypto market.
In 2022, the US National Bureau of Economic Research reported that illegal wash trading may account for as much as 70% of average trading volumes on unregulated exchanges.

The value locked in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (BTCFi) has surged by more than 2,700% over the past year, potentially transforming Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a productive, yield-bearing asset, according to new research from Binance.
BTCFi is a new technological paradigm that aims to bring decentralized finance capabilities to Bitcoin’s base layer. It is one of the fastest-growing crypto sectors, reaching a total value locked (TVL) of over $8.6 billion.
The growing value of BTCFi, “along with potential interest rate cuts, may reinforce positive sentiment for Bitcoin in the medium and long term,” Binance Research wrote in a report shared with Cointelegraph.

If the BTCFi sector’s growth trajectory continues, it could open up “new opportunities for Bitcoin holders to generate yield through lending, liquidity provision, and other DeFi mechanisms,” a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding:

Interest in BTCFi surged after April 2024’s Bitcoin halving, which introduced the Runes protocol, the first fungible token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Several Bitcoin-native projects have helped accelerate the trend. 
Babylon introduced Bitcoin (BTC) staking for the first time in the network’s history, enabling holders to earn passive income from their assets.
Hermetica launched the first Bitcoin-backed synthetic dollar, USDh, which debuted with a 25% yield for investors.

Long-term holders are wallets that have been holding BTC for at least 155 days. Growing accumulation from long-term holders has reduced the available Bitcoin supply on exchanges, which may eventually lead to a supply shock-driven price rally.
The growing accumulation trend among long-term holders aligns with a “significant period of adoption for Bitcoin,” due to the establishment of the US strategic Bitcoin reserve and growing institutional interest, according to the research report.

On March 7, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve using BTC seized from government criminal cases.
Trump signed the historic Bitcoin reserve order a day ahead of hosting the first White House Crypto Summit, which received mixed reactions from the crypto community.

fcd1faa605205566dd6a2290ce45d167,Cointelegraph,How to sell crypto via MetaMask: A beginner’s guide to cashing out,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-sell-crypto-via-meta-mask," To sell crypto via your MetaMask wallet, you need to be aware of swapping, bridging and using fiat off-ramps to convert your crypto into fiat. 
Not all tokens can be sold immediately. Airdropped or obscure tokens may lack liquidity or could be scams, so it’s important to check before attempting to cash out.
Swapping and bridging may be required. To sell, you might need to convert tokens to ETH or stablecoins and bridge them to the Ethereum mainnet.
MetaMask integrates fiat off-ramps. You can use the MetaMask Portfolio to sell ETH directly, but be prepared for KYC with third-party providers.
Non-KYC and P2P options exist. Platforms like Bisq or LocalCoinSwap allow trading without ID, but they carry more risk and require caution.
There are plenty of ways you might end up with a mix of different cryptocurrencies sitting in your MetaMask wallet.
Maybe you work in Web3 — as a developer, copywriter or designer — and your client paid you in their project’s native token.
Or maybe you’re part of a Bitcoin mining pool and occasionally receive rewards straight to your wallet.
You could be farming yield in decentralized finance (DeFi), earning annual percentage yield (APY) on your locked assets. Or, perhaps the most straightforward of all: You completed a few SocialFi tasks and received some community tokens via an airdrop.
Whatever the case, you’ve got crypto in your MetaMask — and now you want to turn it into cash.
In this guide, you’ll learn all the ways you can sell your crypto and withdraw the funds to your bank account or even in cash — whether you’re going through official Know Your Customer (KYC) channels or sticking to more private, non-KYC routes.
Before you can turn your tokens into cash, there are a few things you need to get sorted in MetaMask because “not all tokens are created equal.” It’s not always as simple as hitting a “sell” button — especially if you’ve just received tokens via an airdrop or from a lesser-known project.
Just because a token shows up in your wallet doesn’t mean it’s ready to be sold. In fact, many airdropped tokens aren’t listed on exchanges at all. That means there’s no market where you can sell them — not yet, anyway. You might see a price attached to the token, but without buyers or liquidity, that value isn’t something you can actually realize right now. So, while it’s great to receive free tokens, they may end up sitting idle in your wallet for a while.
Did you know? If you see a “100% sell fee detected” warning on a token, it’s likely a scam. Scammers airdrop these tokens, hoping you’ll try to sell or interact with them. But when you do, the smart contract takes the full amount — leaving you with nothing. Worse, some link to fake decentralized applications (DApps) that ask you to “claim” or “unlock” the tokens. Connecting your wallet or signing a transaction there can let scammers drain your real assets.
Sometimes, you’ll receive tokens that don’t even show up in MetaMask at first. That doesn’t mean they’re not there — it just means MetaMask doesn’t recognize them by default. You’ll need to add them manually by grabbing the token’s contract address (usually from the project’s official site or Etherscan) and importing it into your wallet. Once you do that, your balance will show up properly.
Similarly, if you want to receive any asset other than Ether (ETH), the “Import Tokens” option lets you manually add these missing tokens so they show up in the assets list.
Even if your tokens are visible in MetaMask and technically have value, that doesn’t always mean you can sell them for cash right away. Many smaller or newer tokens don’t have direct fiat trading pairs — so you won’t be able to exchange them straight into dollars or euros. 
To get around this, you’ll usually need to swap them for something more liquid, like ETH or a stablecoin such as USDC (USDC), which are more commonly supported by fiat off-ramps.
In some cases, your tokens might also be sitting on a different blockchain — like Arbitrum, BNB Chain or Polygon — while most fiat withdrawal options only support Ethereum mainnet. When that’s the case, you’ll need to bridge your tokens over to Ethereum before you can sell them.
One way to handle both of these steps — swapping and bridging — is by using platforms that combine them into a single flow. For example, with Symbiosis.finance, you can swap a token on one chain and receive a more widely accepted token on Ethereum, all in one transaction. This can save you a few steps and reduce the chance of user error when hopping between tools.
The simplest way to sell crypto that you hold on MetaMask is by using the application itself. Here’s what to do:
Open MetaMask portfolio: In your MetaMask extension or app, click the “Buy & Sell” button. This will take you to the MetaMask Portfolio site, where you can manage all your assets and begin the selling process.
Start the sale process: Click on “Move crypto” at the top of the page and select “Sell” from the dropdown options.
Choose your region and currency: MetaMask will ask for your country of residence and preferred fiat currency. This step ensures you’re shown accurate provider options and payout methods available in your area.
Enter sale amount: Select Ether and enter how much you’d like to convert.
Pick a payout option: Next, choose where you want the fiat to go. Depending on your region and provider availability, you might be able to send it to a bank account, PayPal or another method.
Compare offers: MetaMask aggregates offers from several third-party providers (like MoonPay, Transak, Sardine, etc.), showing you real-time exchange rates, fees and estimated payout times. Take a moment to compare and pick the best option for you.
Complete the sale: Once you’ve chosen a provider, MetaMask will guide you through sending the crypto. You’ll confirm the transaction in your wallet, and the funds will be transferred to the provider, who handles the fiat payout.
There are two things to keep in mind when using the MetaMask application:
Firstly, while the application itself might not ask you for KYC, the third-party providers will. So, expect to get your documents ready for this one.
Secondly, MetaMask’s sell feature only supports ETH on the Ethereum mainnet. This is where the bridging will come in as was explained earlier.
If you’d rather cash out your crypto through a centralized exchange, Coinbase is a popular option. It’s beginner-friendly, offers fiat withdrawals, and supports a wide range of assets. Just note: You’ll need to complete KYC verification before withdrawing any fiat.
Here’s how to do it, step by step:
First things first: You’ll need to move your funds from MetaMask to Coinbase.
Log in to your Coinbase account and hit “Send & Receive” at the top.
Switch to the “Receive” tab, pick the crypto you’re sending (like ETH or USDC), and copy the wallet address Coinbase gives you.
Make sure the network matches — for example, if you’re sending ETH, it should be on the Ethereum (ERC-20) network.
Now open MetaMask:
Click “Send,” paste in that Coinbase address, and enter how much you want to transfer.
Double-check the network — if you send it to the wrong one, your funds could disappear.
Hit “Confirm,” and your crypto should show up in Coinbase after a few minutes.
Once your funds land in Coinbase, it’s time to cash out.
Head to “Buy & Sell” at the top and switch to the “Sell” tab.
Choose the crypto you just received and decide how much you want to sell.
Pick where you want the money to go — like your linked bank account, PayPal or your Coinbase balance.
Review the details (including any fees), then hit “Sell.”
Did you know? When withdrawing via centralized exchanges, be cautious of minimum withdrawal amounts and any associated fees. Check these details in advance to make sure the limits and costs are acceptable to you before committing to this route.
With peer-to-peer (P2P), you’re not selling your crypto to the exchange. Instead, you’re selling it to another user. You choose a buyer based on their offer and preferred payment method (like bank transfer, Revolut, Wise, etc.). Once they send the money to your account, you release the crypto to them. The platform holds your crypto in escrow during the process, so no one can just disappear with your funds.
With centralized exchanges, you’ll have to complete KYC before you’re able to trade in this manner. 
Go to Trade > P2P.
Choose the coin you want to sell and browse the list of available buyers.
Select a deal, confirm the order, and wait for the buyer to make the payment.
Once the payment has arrived in your account, confirm it and release the crypto from escrow.
Did you know? Some peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchanges offer a “cash by mail” option, allowing users to send physical cash through postal services or couriers to settle transactions.
For those looking to convert cryptocurrency from their MetaMask wallet to fiat currency without undergoing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, there are still a few viable paths.
Decentralized P2P platforms let you trade directly with other users, much like their centralized counterparts, though often with minimal or no KYC requirements. 
LocalCoinSwap: A non-custodial P2P marketplace that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and payment methods, including cash. It offers escrow protection and emphasizes privacy.
Bisq: A fully decentralized exchange that supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Monero (XMR). It runs on a peer-to-peer protocol and doesn’t require user accounts or KYC.
However, without KYC, you’re responsible for vetting the person you’re trading with. Check their reputation, review any available trade history, and always follow platform safety guidelines.
Withdrawing funds from your MetaMask wallet using cryptocurrency ATMs — often referred to as Bitcoin ATMs — is an option that allows you to convert your digital assets into cash. Here’s how you can approach this method:
Locate a cryptocurrency ATM: Begin by finding a cryptocurrency ATM in your vicinity. Websites like CoinATMRadar provide directories of Bitcoin ATM locations worldwide, detailing the services they offer and the cryptocurrencies they support.
Prepare your MetaMask wallet: Ensure that the cryptocurrency you intend to withdraw is supported by the ATM. Bitcoin ATMs predominantly support Bitcoin (BTC), so you may need to use a decentralized exchange (DEX) to swap your current tokens for BTC within your MetaMask wallet. Be mindful of transaction fees and exchange rates during this process.
Initiate the withdrawal process: At the ATM, select the option to withdraw cash. The machine will prompt you to specify the amount you wish to withdraw and provide a QR code representing the ATM’s wallet address.
Transfer funds from MetaMask: Using your MetaMask wallet, scan the QR code provided by the ATM to input the recipient address accurately. Enter the exact amount of cryptocurrency required and confirm the transaction. Be aware that network congestion can affect transaction times.
Collect your cash: Once the blockchain confirms the transaction, the ATM will dispense the equivalent amount in cash, minus any applicable fees. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to longer, depending on network conditions.
When using crypto ATMs, you should expect very high fees, and while small transactions don’t usually require KYC, larger ones still might.
Taxes aren’t the most exciting topic, but they matter when converting crypto from a MetaMask wallet into fiat. Selling crypto, whether through MetaMask, an exchange or a P2P deal, may trigger a taxable event, and understanding the applicable rules is essential.
In most countries, including the US, selling crypto for fiat (like US dollars, euros, etc.) is treated like selling property. That means if you bought ETH at $1,000 and sold it later for $1,500, you’ve made a $500 capital gain — and that’s usually taxable.
Even swapping one crypto for another (say, ETH for USDC) can trigger the same kind of tax obligation, even if no fiat is involved. So, yeah, it’s not just cashing out that counts — any trade can be reportable.
To stay on top of it, keep a record of:
When you bought and sold each asset
How much you bought and/or sold
What it was worth in fiat at the time
Any fees paid along the way.
These details make life way easier when tax season rolls around — or if your accountant gives you that look.
Crypto laws aren’t one-size-fits-all. Every country has its own stance, and even within the same country, rules can vary depending on how you’re using crypto.
In the US, for example, selling crypto could fall under capital gains tax rules or even money transmission laws, depending on how you’re moving the funds. Other countries might have more lenient — or much stricter — regulations.
So, here’s what to do:
Look up your local crypto tax laws (even if they seem vague or outdated).
Stay current — regulations are evolving fast.
Talk to a pro if you’re unsure. A crypto-savvy accountant or legal adviser can help you avoid nasty surprises.
Even if you’re using non-KYC methods or decentralized tools, tax authorities may still expect a full report. Being proactive about it will save you headaches later — and might even save you money.
Happy cashing out!

2930342e49179a5f6f3a7f445b809635,Cointelegraph,Babylon users unstake $21M in Bitcoin following token airdrop,https://cointelegraph.com/news/babylon-21-million-unstaked-baby-airdrop," Over $21 million in Bitcoin was unstaked from Babylon as early users claimed 600 million BABY tokens in the platform’s latest airdrop. 
More than $21 million worth of Bitcoin was unstaked from the Babylon protocol in the 24 hours after the platform’s token airdrop, according to blockchain data shared by a developer.
On April 4, Bitfeed developer Mononaut shared that in the previous 24 hours, 256 Bitcoin (BTC) had been unstaked from the staking protocol. Mononaut said that the unstaking transactions paid 1.35 BTC in fees and consumed 1.318 Megavirtualbytes (MvB) of blockspace. This means the transactions generated high fees and occupied roughly a third of an entire Bitcoin block. 
The activity followed Babylon’s 600 million airdrop of its native token, BABY, which was distributed to early users and contributors.

In a previous Cointelegraph interview, Babylon co-founder Fisher Yu said that, unlike Ethereum and Solana, Bitcoin staking does not reward stakers in the chain’s native asset. Instead, they may get rewards in the form of the native token of the blockchain secured by the staked Bitcoin capital. 
On April 3, the Babylon Foundation announced the details of the airdrop program for its early adopters. The protocol said the airdrop was dedicated to its Phase 1 stakers, non-fungible token (NFT) holders and developers contributing to its ecosystem. 
The staking protocol said it was airdropping 600 million BABY tokens, 6% of its total supply; 30 million BABY were allocated to the protocol’s Pioneer Pass NFT holders, while 5 million BABY were slated for open-source contributors. 
The rest of the tokens were to be distributed among eligible stakers who participated in the protocol’s Phase 1. This included a stake participation airdrop of 30 million BABY, a base staking reward airdrop of 335 million BABY and a bonus staking reward airdrop for Phase 2 transition of 200 million BABY.  
While the platform distributed an airdrop for its early adopters, it clarified that it did not include wallet campaigns and liquid staking incentives in this airdrop event. 
In response to the airdrop, crypto exchange OKX listed the BABY token and USDT pair in pre-market futures. Pre-market futures allow traders to speculate on an asset’s future price. This allows investors to trade BABY futures before the asset becomes available in spot markets.
Data platform DefiLlama shows that Babylon currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $4.29 billion. This represents 80% of the Bitcoin ecosystem’s overall TVL of $5.34 billion.

ec1ae19103b2dc74b4b1844b304a22a0,Cointelegraph,Arthur Hayes loves tariffs as printed money pain is good for Bitcoin,https://cointelegraph.com/news/arthur-hayes-donald-trump-tariffs-bitcoin-price-pump," Arthur Hayes says that tariffs will correct “global imbalances,” which will positively impact Bitcoin's price over the medium term. 
BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says US President Donald Trump's tariffs may rattle the global economy in some ways, but that same disruption could be exactly what Bitcoin needs to rally.
“Global imbalances will be corrected, and the pain papered over with printed money, which is good for BTC,” Hayes said in an April 3 X post.
“Some of y'all are running scurred, but I LOVE TARIFFS,” Hayes said. 
His comments come just a day after it was announced that the Trump administration will hit all countries with a 10% tariff starting April 5, with some countries facing even larger rates, such as China facing a 34% tariff, the European Union 20%, and Japan 24%. 
Hayes explained that tariffs positively impact Bitcoin's (BTC) price for several reasons.

One of them, he said, is the “weakening” of the US Dollar Index (DXY), as overseas investors continue to sell off US stocks and “bring money home.” 
April 3 marked “the largest single-day point loss for the Nasdaq 100 in history,” according to the trading resource account The Kobeissi Letter.
“The index lost a total of -1060 points and came just 1.5% away from triggering the first circuit breaker since March 2020,” The Kobeissi Letter said.
""This is good for BTC and gold over the medium term.""
Hayes also said that the stringent tariff placed on China may weaken the yuan (CNY). “With a 65% effective tariff levied, China could respond by allowing CNY to weaken past 8.00,” Hayes said. 
A weakening yuan may force the hand of Chinese investors to look at riskier assets such as Bitcoin to preserve their wealth.
Meanwhile, Hayes said that “we need Fed easing,” noting that the two-year Treasury yield “dumped” following the tariff announcement.

He explained this as a signal that markets expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates and potentially restart quantitative easing (QE) to offset the negative economic impact.

Meanwhile, Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, has long argued that Trump's tariffs will ultimately benefit Bitcoin.
He said on Feb. 3 that in a “world of weaker dollar and weaker US rates…risk assets in the US will fly through the roof beyond your wildest imagination.”
“Bookmark this and revisit as the financial war unravels, sending Bitcoin violently higher,” Parks said on Feb. 3.

561746d213f142f0b92b01cd7f85d194,Cointelegraph,"Altcoins are set for one last big rally, but just a few will benefit — Analyst",https://cointelegraph.com/news/altcoins-one-last-rally-network-activity-big-signal-analyst," Real Vision's Jamie Coutts is watching June for a potential altcoin market recovery but says traders should treat network activity as the “north star” for crypto investing. 
Altcoins may have just one last rally this cycle, but only those with real utility and strong network activity will see price gains, according to an analyst. 
“I think there will be one more breadth thrust from altcoins. The question is, is it a sustained rally that we will see for six to twelve months,” Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts told Real Vision co-founder Raoul Pal on an April 3 X livestream.
“At this stage, I am not too sure, but I do believe that quality altcoins where activity returns, activity drives prices …we will definitely see a recovery in some of these more high-quality names,” Coutts said.
Cointelegraph reported in January that there were over 36 million altcoins in existence. However, Ethereum still holds the majority share of total value locked (TVL) with 55.56%, followed by Solana (6.89%), Bitcoin (5.77%), BNB Smart Chain (5.68%), and Tron (5.54%), according to CoinGecko data.
Coutts said traders should watch where the network activity “is gravitating” and use that as their “north star” for how to trade in crypto, adding he sees an altcoin market upswing within the next two months. 
On March 28, Coutts told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin could reach all-time highs before the end of Q2 regardless of whether there is more clarity on US President Donald Trump's tariffs and potential recession concerns.

Blockchain network activity across the board has recently experienced sharp declines amid a broader crypto market downturn. On Feb. 21, Cointelegraph reported that the number of active addresses on the Solana (SOL) network fell to a weekly average of 9.5 million in February, down nearly 40% from the 15.6 million active addresses in November 2024.
Meanwhile, several key indicators the crypto industry uses to determine an incoming altcoin season suggest it's still nowhere in sight.
Capriole Investments’ Altcoin Speculation Index has dropped to 12%, down 53% since Dec. 25, the same period during which Ether fell 49% from $3,490, according to CoinMarketCap data.

CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, which measures the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days, is reading a score of 14 out of 100, leaning toward a more Bitcoin-dominated market, referring to it as “Bitcoin Season.”

However, while Bitcoin dominance — a level often watched for retracements that signal an altcoin season — sits at 62.84%, some analysts argue it’s no longer as relevant as a signal for altcoin season.
CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Yu recently said that Bitcoin Dominance “no longer defines altseason — trading volume does.”

84adb395f3f4613d3034af711b686c20,Cointelegraph,Genius Group says it’s been banned from buying more Bitcoin,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-firm-genius-group-orced-sell-bitcoin-treasury," The preliminary injunction blocking Bitcoin purchases is connected with a broader dispute surrounding a merger with Fatbrain AI that went sour in October last year. 
Singapore-based artificial intelligence firm Genius Group says it’s temporarily barred from expanding its Bitcoin treasury after a US court order has banned it from selling shares, raising funds and using investor funds to buy more Bitcoin.
A New York District court issued the preliminary injunction (PI) and temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 13 in connection with a broader dispute surrounding its merger with Fatbrain AI, the Genius Group said in an April 3 statement.
Fatbrain AI and Genius Group completed a merger and purchase agreement in March 2024, but by Oct. 30, Genius initiated arbitration procedures to terminate, alleging fraud by Fatbrain AI executives connected to the deal.

In February, Fatbrain AI executives Michael Moe and Peter Ritz filed for the TRO and permanent injunction, blocking Genius Group from selling its shares, raising funds and buying more Bitcoin pending the arbitration outcome. 
The injunction has forced Genius Group to close divisions, halt marketing activities and sell 10 Bitcoin (BTC) from its stash of 440, worth over $23 million at current prices, to continue funding its operations. The firm hasn’t ruled out more sales in the future.
“Genius is taking all necessary measures to minimize Bitcoin sales but anticipates that it will need to downsize its Bitcoin Treasury in the coming months in the event the PI remains in place,” the firm said.
Fatbrain AI shareholders also filed two lawsuits against Fatbrain AI executives, including Moe and Ritz, and Genius Group, in April 2024, alleging violation of federal securities laws in connection with the merger, ASX law said in an October statement.

Genius Group was subsequently voluntarily dismissed from the suits on Feb. 14. 
Genius Group says the US court injunction has also forced it to break Singapore law by halting share compensation to employees as part of its employment agreements.
“We never dreamed that it was possible that a US court could block the company from being able to issue shares, raise funds or buy Bitcoin — all actions that would normally be decided by a public company's shareholders or Board rather than a court,” said Genius Group CEO Roger James Hamilton.

He said the firm will “continue to fly the flag for Bitcoin,” even when legally banned from building out its treasury.
Fatbrain AI didn’t immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.
Artificial intelligence firm Genius Group first announced in November 2024 that it had taken the first steps to build a Bitcoin treasury by purchasing 110 Bitcoin for $10 million.
The firm had earlier announced its overall goal of committing 90% or more of its current and future reserves to be held in Bitcoin, with an initial target of $120 million, which saw the stock price surge by 66%. 
Genius Group’s share price is down 9.80% in the last trading session to $0.23, with a further 3.74% drop after the bell to $0.22, Google Finance data shows.

6034707c43205510c9f2cba261199484,Cointelegraph,10-year Treasury yield falls to 4% as DXY softens — Is it time to buy the Bitcoin price dip?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/10-year-treasury-yield-falls-to-4-as-dxy-softens-is-it-time-to-buy-the-bitcoin-price-dip," Will the US-led trade war lead to a golden buying opportunity in Bitcoin price or further downside in the short term? 
On April 3, yields on long-term US government debt fell to their lowest levels in six months as investors reacted to growing concerns over the global trade war and the weakening of the US dollar. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly touched 4.0%, down from 4.4% a week earlier, signaling strong demand from buyers.

At first glance, a higher risk of economic recession may seem negative for Bitcoin (BTC). However, lower returns from fixed-income investments encourage allocations to alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Over time, traders are likely to reduce exposure to bonds, particularly if inflation rises. As a result, the path to a Bitcoin all-time high in 2025 remains plausible.
One could argue that the recently announced US import tariffs negatively impact corporate profitability, forcing some companies to deleverage and, in turn, reducing market liquidity. Ultimately, any measure that increases risk aversion tends to have a short-term negative effect on Bitcoin, particularly given its strong correlation with the S&P 500 index.
Axel Merk, chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Merk Investments, said that tariffs create a “supply shock,” meaning the reduced availability of goods and services due to rising prices causes an imbalance relative to demand. This effect is amplified if interest rates are declining, potentially paving the way for inflationary pressure.
Source: X/AxelMerk
Even if one does not view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, the appeal of fixed-income investments diminishes significantly in such a scenario. Moreover, if just 5% of the world’s $140 trillion bond market seeks higher returns elsewhere, it could translate into $7 trillion in potential inflows into stocks, commodities, real estate, gold, and Bitcoin.
Gold surged to a $21 trillion market capitalization as it made consecutive all-time highs, and it still has the potential for significant price upside. Higher prices allow previously unprofitable mining operations to resume and it encourages further investment in exploration, extraction, and refining. As production expands, the supply growth will naturally act as a limiting factor on gold’s long-term bull run.
Regardless of trends in US interest rates, the US dollar has weakened against a basket of foreign currencies, as measured by the DXY Index. On April 3, the index dropped to 102, its lowest level in six months. A decline in confidence in the US dollar, even in relative terms, could encourage other nations to explore alternative stores of value, including Bitcoin.

This transition does not happen overnight, but the trade war could lead to a gradual shift away from the US dollar, particularly among countries that feel pressured by its dominant role. While no one expects a return to the gold standard or Bitcoin to become a major component of national reserves, any movement away from the dollar strengthens Bitcoin’s long-term upside potential and reinforces its position as an alternative asset.

To put things in perspective, Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore collectively hold $2.63 trillion in US Treasuries. If these regions choose to retaliate, bond yields could reverse their trend, increasing the cost of new debt issuance for the US government and further weakening the dollar. In such a scenario, investors would likely avoid adding exposure to stocks, ultimately favoring scarce alternative assets like Bitcoin.
Timing Bitcoin’s market bottom is nearly impossible, but the fact that the $82,000 support level held despite worsening global economic uncertainty is an encouraging sign of its resilience.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

Cango, a publicly traded Chinese conglomerate, has agreed to sell its legacy China operations to an entity associated with peer Bitmain in a bid to go all-in on Bitcoin (BTC) mining, according to a report by The Miner Mag. 
Cango agreed to sell its legacy Chinese auto financing business to Ursalpha Digital Limited in a $352 million deal, according to the report.
 Additionally, Bitmain is reportedly transferring 32 exahashes per second (EH/s) to Cango. The deal effectively brings Bitmain’s mining assets to the public market, The Miner Mag said.
Exahashes measure a miner’s contribution to the Bitcoin network’s hashrate, the total computing power securing the network.
The Miner Mag said Ursalpha Digital Limited has the same corporate address and founding director as Antalpha, an entity ultimately controlled by the chairman of Bitcoin miner Bitmain.

Bitmain has experienced US scrutiny after the country blacklisted its artificial intelligence affiliate Sopghgo, Bloomberg reported. 
According to Bloomberg, Bitmain has a working relationship with American Bitcoin, a Trump-family-affiliated mining entity created in March as part of a deal with Hut 8, a provider of power and computing infrastructure. 
On March 31, Hut 8 bought a majority ownership interest in American Bitcoin (formerly American Data Centers), whose founders include US President Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. 
Hut 8 has transferred its Bitcoin mining equipment to American Bitcoin, which is reportedly mulling an initial public offering (IPO), according to Bloomberg. 
The companies said that American Bitcoin will focus on crypto mining, while Hut 8 targets data center infrastructure for applications such as high-performance computing. 
In 2025, Bitcoin mining stocks have struggled amid declining cryptocurrency prices and pressure on business models caused by the Bitcoin network’s April halving, according to a JPMorgan research note shared with Cointelegraph.
Every four years, the amount of BTC mined per “block” — a bundle of transaction data stored on the chain — is cut in half. April’s halving slashed mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.

cd42ed4c86be762452cd63bb6f8d3312,Cointelegraph,Pre-seed crypto startup deals have grown 767% since 2021: Report,https://cointelegraph.com/news/pre-seed-bitcoin-funding-deals-report," Bitcoin-specific startups accounted for only about 6% of the total crypto funding deals in 2024, according to a report from Trammell Venture Partners. 
The number of pre-seed funding rounds for Bitcoin (BTC) startup companies has grown by 767% since 2021, according to a report from venture capital firm Trammell Venture Partners (TVP).
Bitcoin pre-seed transactions increased 50% year-over-year in 2024, with a 27.5% year-over-year increase in the number of startup companies funded.
Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director, attributed the increased deals to the robust security of the BTC network:
However, the capital raised in Bitcoin pre-seed funding rounds declined by over 22% in 2024, with the median funding round size and the median startup valuation steadily declining from 2021 to 2023.

The value of funding rounds reclaimed some lost ground in 2024 but failed to reach highs established during the previous bull cycle in 2021, primarily due to unclear crypto regulations in the United States under the previous Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) leadership.
More recently, macroeconomic uncertainty due to fears of a prolonged trade war, relatively high interest rates, and the possibility of a recession in the United States have also eroded the risk appetite for speculative assets like crypto.

In January, Deng Chao, CEO of institutional asset manager HashKey Capital, told Cointelegraph that pro-crypto regulations in the United States would increase VC investment in the sector in 2025.
However, the executive warned that macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical turmoil could increase price volatility and disrupt the trend brought on by positive regulatory tailwinds.
On April 2, US President Donald Trump signed a sweeping tariff order establishing a 10% baseline tariff on import goods from all countries and a regime of reciprocal trade tariffs on trading partners that sent financial markets tumbling.

Risk-on assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies typically suffer during trade wars and macroeconomic uncertainty, as investors flee risk assets for safer alternatives such as cash, government securities, and durable commodities.
Venture capital firm Haun Ventures invested $1.5 billion into crypto firms in 2022 but recently announced it seeks to raise only $1 billion in the first half of 2025, citing changed market conditions.
Similarly, analysts at Galaxy Digital also predicted a 50% year-over-year rise in VC-led crypto investments in 2025 but said that VC funding will fail to reach highs established in 2021–2022.

Should traders expect a relief rally due to oversold conditions? 
Bitcoin (BTC) and US stock markets all sold off sharply after US President Donald Trump shook up financial markets by announcing a list of reciprocal tariffs on several countries. 
On April 3, the S&P 500 saw a 4.2% drop at market open, its most significant single-day decline since June 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.41%, to 40,785.41 from 42,225.32, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.23%. Overall, $1.6 trillion in value was wiped out from US stock at the market open. 
Bitcoin’s value dropped by 8%, but a positive is bulls seem capable of defending the $80,000 support level. These steep declines essentially stem from uncertainty surrounding the new tariffs and amplify investors’ concerns about impending recession.

Data from CoinGecko suggests that the total crypto market has dropped 6.8% over the past 24 hours and it seems unlikely that a relief rally is viable in the short-term.

According to CoinGlass, in the past 24 hours, more than 200,000 traders were liquidated, with the total amount exceeding $573.4 million. The largest liquidation occurred on Binance, with an ETH/USDT position worth $11.97 million being force closed.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s open interest dropped below $50 billion, reducing market leverage. Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal, mentioned that the liquidation heatmaps indicate heavy leverage around $80,000, raising the potential for a potential drop to $64K-$65K if Bitcoin breaks this level with high trading volume.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed the first trip below $82,000 for BTC/USD since the start of the month.
After initially surging as high as $88,580 as the US government unveiled reciprocal trade tariffs, Bitcoin soon ran out of steam as the reality of the stronger-than-expected measures hit home.
US stocks then followed, with the S&P 500 down over 4% on the day at the time of writing.
“Today's -3.7% drop puts the S&P 500 on track for its largest daily decline since the 2020 pandemic lockdowns,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of a reaction on X.

Thereafter, US initial jobless claims came in below estimates, at 219,000 versus the anticipated 228,000, per data from the US Department of Labor (DoL).
“The previous week's level was revised up by 1,000 from 224,000 to 225,000. The 4-week moving average was 223,000, a decrease of 1,250 from the previous week's revised average. The previous week's average was revised up by 250 from 224,000 to 224,250,” an official press release stated.
Stronger labor market trends are traditionally associated with weaker risk-asset performance as they imply that policymakers can keep financial conditions tighter for longer.
Data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool nonetheless continued to see markets favor an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve at the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

“As recession odds rise, markets think that the Fed will be forced to cut rates as soon as next month,” Kobeissi added.
BTC price action predictably continued to disappoint on short timeframes as $80,000 support became uncomfortably close.

“I could see a stop hunt below the local lows before a pump to squeeze shorts, then probably more chop that slopes downward,” he told X followers.

Onchain analytics firm Glassnode had more bad news. According to their data, Bitcoin printed a new “death cross” involving the convergence of two midterm moving averages (MAs).
“An onchain analogue to the Death Cross has emerged. The 30-day volume-weighted price of $BTC has crossed below the 180-day, signaling weakening momentum,” an X post announced.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has been consolidating in a wide range between $80,000 to $88,500 since March 12. 
Data suggests that Bitcoin’s consolidation may continue for some time, with onchain indicators pointing to the continuation of the “broader downtrend.” The key question that remains is when Bitcoin’s consolidation will end.

One of the clearest signs that there is more choppy price action ahead for Bitcoin is the presence of muted funding rates in the BTC futures markets.
Key points:
Funding rates are periodic payments made between long and short traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep prices aligned with the spot market.
When this metric turns negative, it means short sellers are paying long holders, indicating that bearish sentiment dominates.
BTC funding rates have been oscillating around 0% since late February, indicating indecisiveness dominates the market.

When funding rates are zero, the cost of holding positions is minimal, reducing pressure on traders to exit longs or shorts and leading to price consolidation.
Commenting on the funding rate, crypto analyst Axel Adler Junior said that Bitcoin’s average funding rate on major exchanges “has dropped into negative territory,” currently sitting just above zero.
According to the analyst, positive signals from the US Federal Reserve and the Trump administration could renew fresh inflows into the market, “potentially triggering the start of a new rally.”
Several onchain metrics suggest Bitcoin’s April 2 rally to $87,500 was just a “relief rally within a broader downtrend rather than the beginning of a sustained reversal,” according to market intelligence firm Glassnode.
In its latest market report, Glassnode found that the 90-day simple moving average of Bitcoin’s Realized Profit/Loss Ratio had declined significantly since January, despite repeated rallies in the $76,000–$80,000 range.
These brief profit-driven surges have failed to end the ongoing consolidation, suggesting that the “macro picture remains one of generally weaker liquidity and deteriorating investor profitability,” it said.

An accompanying chart shows data from the onchain volume-weighted prices metric, which calculates a price level weighted by the volume of coins moved onchain over a specific timeframe.
Using this, Glassnode can compare when and how much capital was actually moved in the last 1 month compared to the last 6 months, giving a direct reflection of market trends.
The recent cross-over of the short-term 1-month average below the long-term 6-month price indicates an onchain “death cross,” Glassnode said.

Anticipation of a breakout in BTC price lingers in the background, as suggested by Bitcoin’s volatility indicator.
Key points:
Tightening Bollinger Bands conditions indicate that a breakout might be very close.
The weekly Bollinger Bandwidth is at an extremely oversold level, touching its lower green line.
The width of the Bollinger Bands is as tight as it was between July 2024 and November 2024 when it consolidated between $55,000 and $69,000, the 2021 all-time high.
BTC/USD then rallied 60% from $67,500 in October 2026 to its previous high of $106,000 reached in December 2024.
The indicator was also this tight between July 2023 and October 2023, preceding a 176% rally in BTC price from $24,400 to $73,800 on March 14, 2024.

The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast looks at Bitcoin’s scalability, security and its future as a global financial force. 
Bitcoin’s (BTC) journey from a radical experiment to a trillion-dollar asset has been fueled by grand narratives: Digital gold, decentralized money and an alternative financial system. Beyond the hype, how does Bitcoin remain true to its core values? 
That’s the central theme of the latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, where hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson are joined by Charlie Spears, co-founder of Blockspace Media, to unpack Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system.
From the outset, Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized alternative to traditional money.
But as adoption has surged, so too has the debate over its scalability and usability. Jenkinson began the conversation by explaining the origins of the original cryptocurrency and how that has shifted over time:
The discussion underscores the growing importance of layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which aim to make Bitcoin practical for everyday transactions by enabling users to transact in satoshis — the smallest unit of Bitcoin — rather than traditional currencies.

Debates over Bitcoin’s direction often center on its philosophical roots. Some purists argue that any modification risks altering the essence of what makes Bitcoin unique. 
Others see thoughtful updates as a way to reinforce its role as a global financial system. Spears compares this to interpreting historical texts: 
The discussion highlights how some proposed upgrades aren’t new but were initially removed as a precaution. Now, with Bitcoin’s maturity, developers are considering reinstating them to improve functionality. 
“Bitcoin is in the hands of its users,” Spears emphasizes. “We get to decide what it should be, just as much as those who were there 15 years ago.”
As Bitcoin continues to evolve, The Clear Crypto Podcast cuts through the noise to deliver insightful conversations about where it’s headed next.

Cryptocurrency listings have outperformed the average of traditional stock listings, despite recent community criticism regarding the manipulation potential of token listings on centralized exchanges.
Token listing procedures on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) drew significant controversy after Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, co-founder and former CEO of Binance, called the process flawed after disappointing performances of some token listings.
Despite the criticism, crypto exchanges have outperformed traditional stock exchanges in terms of listings with positive returns on investment (ROI) and average ROI, according to an April 3 CoinMarketCap report shared exclusively with Cointelegraph.

Cryptocurrency markets could be on track for recovery as investor sentiment begins to stabilize following US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcement — what some analysts are calling the peak of recent market uncertainty.
Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2, which sent tremors across global markets. The S&P 500 lost more than $5 trillion, its largest drop on record, surpassing the pandemic-induced crash in March 2020, according to Reuters.
Still, some analysts see a silver lining to the tariff announcement.
“In my opinion, the tariffs are the representation of the uncertainty in the markets,” Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph. “Liberation Day is basically the peak of that period, the climax of uncertainty. Now it’s out in the open. Everybody knows the new playing field.”
Van de Poppe added that he believes Trump is using tariffs as a strategic move to stimulate domestic growth and reduce yields. “Tariffs are literally the only way to do that,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re reversed within the next six to 12 months.”

President Trump’s plan imposes a 10% baseline tariff on all US imports from April 5 and a higher “reciprocal tariff” of up to 54% on select countries with larger trade deficits from April 9.

Still, the end of the uncertainty could bring renewed investment into crypto markets, leading to a recovery, Van de Poppe said:
He noted that the economic impact of the tariffs may ultimately lead the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and begin a new round of quantitative easing (QE), a monetary policy that involves the Fed buying bonds to inject liquidity into the economy.
Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer at Maelstrom, has predicted Bitcoin could climb to $250,000 if the Fed formally enters a QE cycle.

On the downside, the tariff-related uncertainty may continue pressuring risk asset appetite for weeks, according to Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter.
“We can count on President Trump changing his mind a few times within the first couple of weeks,” Acheson told Cointelegraph. She added:
“For crypto, BTC continues to act like a risk asset short-term while its analog counterpart gold breaks through one all-time high after another,” a development that may impact crypto investor sentiment in the short term, Acheson said.
Meanwhile, crypto intelligence firm Nansen estimated a 70% probability that the market could bottom by June, depending on how the tariff negotiations evolve.

China’s response to America’s sweeping trade tariffs could result in capital flight to Bitcoin and crypto, according to BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes.
“If not the Fed [Federal Reserve], then the PBOC [People’s Bank of China] will give us the Yahtzee ingredients,” said Hayes on X on April 8 in reference to the catalyst needed to resume the crypto market bull run.
Hayes said that if the Chinese central bank devalued its currency, the yuan, the “narrative [is] that Chinese capital flight will flow into Bitcoin,” adding that “it worked in 2013, 2015, and can work in 2025.” 
Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou said that China will try to lower the yuan to counter the tariff, adding that historically, whenever the yuan drops, “a lot of Chinese capital flows into BTC,” which is bullish for Bitcoin (BTC).

China devalued the yuan by nearly 2% against the US dollar, which saw the largest single-day drop in decades in August 2015. Bitcoin did see some increased interest during this period, though the direct causative relationship is debated.
When the yuan fell below the symbolic 7:1 ratio against the USD in August 2019, Bitcoin also saw price increases in the same timeframe. Some analysts suggested that Chinese investors were using Bitcoin as a hedge as the asset jumped 20% in the first week of that month. 
In 2019, crypto asset manager Grayscale noted the depreciation in the Chinese yuan at attributed it as a factor that spurred Bitcoin markets at the time. 
Wealthy Chinese citizens may have used crypto in the past to preserve their wealth, move it beyond government reach, and avoid capital controls and restrictions within the country, according to analysts. 
It is also believed that currency devaluations also damage trust in central banks and government financial management, pushing people toward decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin.

The account, which has a verified badge and 852,000 followers, caused quite a stir after the rumor was mistakenly aired as a banner on CNBC and then amplified by Reuters.
The S&P 500 spiked more than 8% from its low on the day in reaction, the Nasdaq added 9.5% in less than an hour and the Dow Jones pumped 7%, adding trillions to stock markets. 
Bitcoin (BTC) prices saw a similar spike, with the asset pumping 6.5% to top $80,000 briefly before falling back again. 
The official White House “Rapid Response” account quickly posted on X that this was fake news, and markets began to dump again. 
While the rumor was debunked as fake, crypto YouTuber Lark Davis said that the episode revealed some critical things about the market. 
The market is ready to accept prolonged China negotiations as long as most deals can be resolved, he said before adding the “market is ready to ape, even a lame 90-day delay sent markets soaring.”  
“Now imagine what happens when dozens of deals are made with top players ie, India, Canada, and the UK. Shit tons of money is on the sidelines, ready to ape in at a moment's notice.”
“That fake headline might actually give Trump, Navarro, and Lutnick more confidence to keep pushing this further,” commented X user Geiger Capital, who added, “They now know that at any point they can announce a pause and the market will rally ~10% in a single day.”
Fox News asked Hasset whether Trump would consider a 90-day pause in tariffs and was given a non-committal response. “I think the president is gonna decide what the president is gonna decide,” he said, adding: “Even if you think there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that’s still a small share of GDP.”

“The idea that it's going to be a nuclear winter or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric,” he said.

Shortly after the 90-day tariff pause post was deleted, Trump took to his own social media platform, Truth Social, to threaten China with even more tariffs. 
“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long-term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, the United States will impose additional tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” he said.

76759a2a2c66273534b21efe46327cfa,Cointelegraph,Lawyer sues US homeland dept to probe supposed Satoshi Nakamoto meeting,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-lawyer-sues-homeland-security-in-effort-unmask-satoshi," Crypto lawyer James Murphy has sued the US Department of Homeland Security to force the agency into disclosing whom it believes is Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. 
Update: April 8 at 1:01am UTC: This article has been updated to include James Murphy’s responses to two questions from Cointelegraph.
A crypto lawyer has sued the US Department of Homeland Security, alleging the agency may know who created Bitcoin — compelling the department to share what it knows. 
The Freedom of Information Act lawsuit was filed by James Murphy, who based his accusations on claims made by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud at a conference in April 2019, where she said a few of her colleagues had previously met with four people involved in creating Bitcoin.
“My FOIA lawsuit simply asks for the notes, email and other documents relating to that alleged interview,” Murphy posted to X after announcing the April 7 suit.  
“IF the interview really happened as the DHS Agent claimed, there should be documentation of the substance of that meeting,” added Murphy, who goes by MetaLawMan on X.
Source: James Murphy
Speaking at the OffshoreAlert Conference North America in Miami in April 2019, Saoud said DHS agents met with the four people it believed to have created Bitcoin, asking what their motives were and what the “end game” is for Bitcoin.
“The agents flew to California and they realized that he wasn’t alone in creating this, there were three other people, they sat down and talked with them to find out how this actually works and what the reason for it was,” Saoud said in the presentation, which is available on YouTube.
If the DHS resists disclosure, Murphy said he will “pursue the case to conclusion” to solve the mystery.
Murphy, however, noted that it is possible that Saoud and the other DHS agents were mistaken and did not interview the real Satoshi Nakamoto.

Murphy is being assisted by former Assistant US Attorney Brian Field, who specializes in Freedom of Information Act litigation.
The purpose of the Freedom of Information Act is to promote transparency and accountability by granting the public access to information held by the government.
Cointelegraph asked Murphy two questions about the DHS lawsuit. Here are his responses in full. 
Question #1: What is your gut feeling—do you think the DHS actually interviewed the real Satoshi?Answer: “I think it’s very possible that the DHS agent was mistaken in what she said at that conference. I think DHS agents may have met with bitcoin code maintainers, or with actual Satoshi imposters. But, who knows? The DHS agent was a pretty high ranking official and was in a position to know what she was talking about. Either way, I think it will be productive to find out and hopefully resolve this question. Nothing prevents DHS from voluntarily revealing the information without need for protracted litigation.”Question #2: If the agency did speak with the four creators — who may be ordinary US citizens — why do you believe revealing their identities serves the public interest, even if it could put their safety or privacy at risk?Answer: “I don’t understand the question. The identities of the creators of all of the largest blockchain projects, like Charles Hoskinson and Vitalik Buterin etc., are all well known in the crypto community. There are also many major figures like Michael Saylor, Tim Draper and others who have amassed enormous wealth through investment in bitcoin and their identities are well known.There are hundreds of documentaries on YouTube where amateur sleuths have tried to identify Satoshi. I’m not one of them. I’m not hiring investigators to try to track down Satoshi, I’m seeking government records under transparency laws in effect in the U.S. If DHS did, in fact, learn Satoshi’s identity, then I’m not sure what the rationale is for dozens of government employees to have this information but withhold it from the general public. Our government is required to be transparent and not keep secrets from the citizens, absent a legitimate national security concern or other limited exemption. We consider this a fundamental aspect of our freedom in the USA. It is why we have something called the “Freedom of Information Act.” Transparency is good, the government hiding information from the citizenry is generally bad.
I am open about the fact that I am pro-bitcoin, having been an investor in bitcoin and a bitcoin miner since 2017. I speak to groups of executives and policy makers about bitcoin and I advocate for bitcoin adoption. What I find when I give these talks is very often these audiences (who are new to bitcoin) struggle with the idea that the creator of bitcoin is unknown while the provenance of the other major crypto projects is (relatively) transparent.
So, my intention is to either conclusively refute the claim of the DHS agent that they interviewed Satoshi, or achieve some transparency that will open the door to greater bitcoin adoption in the U.S. and around the globe. I support President Trump’s initiatives to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Since the bitcoin code is open source and can only be changed through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) procedure, Satoshi (if he or they were identified) would have no ability to unilaterally affect changes to bitcoin. As a result, any revelation of Satoshi’s identity is unlikely to adversely impact bitcoin. It’s more likely that such transparency would be a net positive for growing bitcoin adoption. Others may have different views on that and I respect their opinions.”
The lawsuit follows a wave of recent efforts attempting to uncover Satoshi’s identity.Last October, a controversial HBO documentary claimed that Peter Todd, a Bitcoin cypherpunk, invented Bitcoin. Todd refuted that conclusion, and most industry pundits said HBO’s evidence was weak.
Nick Szabo, Adam Back and Hal Finney have also had their names tied to Satoshi’s identity. Szabo and Back regularly refute claims they’re Satoshi, as did Finney before he died in 2013.
Meanwhile, members of the Bitcoin community are split on whether unveiling Satoshi’s identity would be a net positive for Bitcoin.
Some worry that revealing Satoshi's identity could compromise Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos and put Satoshi’s safety at risk, while others want to be reassured that Bitcoin wasn’t created by the US government.

22b80ef9941a374bb731aed0d598dedc,Cointelegraph,How low can the Bitcoin price go?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-low-can-the-bitcoin-price-go," Analysts warn that Bitcoin is not in the clear yet, raising the chance of further price downside to the $60,000 level. 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a four-month low of $74,500 on April 7, and data suggests that the price may not have bottomed yet. 
Investors dumped risk assets after US President Donald Trump doubled down on his plan to impose global tariffs over the weekend, triggering a $9.5 trillion wipeout in global equity markets.

Growing calls for a US recession have spooked risk investors while leaving crypto market participants wondering how low can the Bitcoin price go in the near future.
Bitcoin is currently testing a critical technical level—the 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA)—which has historically acted as a dividing line between bull and bear phases. 
According to market analyst Ted Pillows and numerous other chartists, Bitcoin must reclaim the EMA, currently near $77,500, to avoid a deeper correction.

If BTC fails to close back above it, Pillows warns of a potential decline toward the $69,000–$70,000 range, which aligns with the 2021 cycle highs. A further drop to $67,000, the average entry-level of Strategy’s Michael Saylor, also remains a possibility.

Bitcoin appeared to have found short-term support at around $74,000, which corresponds to a notable cost-basis cluster where over 50,000 BTC are held. 
Glassnode’s UTXO realized price distribution (URPD) heatmap shows this is the first major cost-basis cluster below $80,000. These holders raised their average buy price until March 10, then stopped moving coins—showing confidence, not panic.

Investors hold around 175,000 BTC in the $74,000–$70,000 range, creating a strong buffer zone. The largest cluster sits at $71,600, with 41,000 BTC concentrated there, making it the likely next support if $74,000 breaks.

Meanwhile, Glassnode’s Short-Term Holder (STH) realized price bands place the current average STH cost basis at $89,000, with the -1 standard deviation band at $69,000.

This level has acted as a historical “max pain” zone for short-term investors during pullbacks in previous bull cycles, suggesting the $69,000 level is a floor where weak hands capitulate and long-term investors often step in.
Historical patterns reveal Bitcoin entering a prolonged bear market after breaking decisively below the 50-week EMA support. In most cases, such corrections have led the price toward the 200-week EMA, as shown in red circular areas below.

If the fractal analysis plays out as intended, Bitcoin’s price target in the event of a 50-week EMA breakdown appears to be around $50,000, aligning with the 200-week EMA’s current positioning.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

US President Donald Trump's trade policies will create worldwide macroeconomic turmoil and short-term financial crises that will ultimately lead to greater adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) as a store of value asset, according to Bitwise analyst Jeff Park.
Economic instability from the trade war will cause governments to adopt inflationary fiscal and monetary policies, which will further debase currencies and lead to a worldwide flight to safety in alternative stores of value, like Bitcoin, Park argued. 
This increased demand for BTC will drive prices much higher in the long term, the analyst concluded. In an X post on Feb. 2, Park predicted the immediate impact of a trade war:
Despite the Increased demand for Bitcoin as a store of value against rapidly depreciating fiat currencies driving BTC prices higher in the long term, global financial markets would feel the short-term pain and wealth destruction of the trade war, according to Park.

The analyst said the US economy has a 40% chance of a recession in 2025 amid fears of a lengthy trade war and the macroeconomic uncertainty brought on by protectionist trade policies.
Asset manager Anthony Pompliano recently speculated that the US president is deliberately crashing capital markets to force interest rate cuts and lower the costs of servicing the US national debt.

Pompliano also concluded that while the current US administration's policies will create short-term pain, the effect of lower interest rates will encourage borrowing and drive risk-on asset prices higher in the long term.

The most successful cryptocurrency traders are still chasing quick profits in memecoins, despite signs that the broader “supercycle” for the speculative assets may be winding down. The shift follows recent disappointment tied to memecoin launches associated with US President Donald Trump.
The industry’s most successful cryptocurrency traders by returns — tracked as “smart money” traders on Nansen’s blockchain intelligence platform — continue hunting for quick memecoin returns.
While growing stablecoin holdings show increased caution, smart money remains open to speculative plays, according to Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at Nansen.
“There was the recent meme surge and smart money is always happy to capitulate on that. But they’re also happy to rotate out of these quickly as well,” he said during Cointelegraph’s Chainreaction live show on X.
“The recent meme frenzy was just a fun play they worked on, while the broader market is sorting out the direction because memecoins aren’t necessarily affected by the same macroeconomy as Bitcoin and Ethereum,” he added.

The memecoin launchpad’s weekly usage metrics peaked on the week of Trump’s inauguration and have since declined. Total active wallets on Pump.fun fell from 2.85 million on the week of Jan. 20 to just 1.44 million as of March 31.
The decline is mainly attributed to a decay in investor sentiment, a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding:

Bitcoin is gaining renewed attention as a hedge against financial instability after holding relatively steady during a record-breaking stock market downturn that saw $5 trillion wiped from the S&P 500.
The S&P 500 posted a $5 trillion loss in market capitalization over two days, its largest drop on record, surpassing the $3.3 trillion decline in March 2020 during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an April 5 report by Reuters.
The record sell-off occurred after US President Donald Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2. The measures aim to shrink the country’s estimated trade deficit of $1.2 trillion in goods and boost domestic manufacturing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) dip after the tariff announcement was significantly smaller than traditional markets, proving Bitcoin’s growing maturity as a global asset, according to Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and chief operating officer of RedStone blockchain oracle firm.
“What we’re potentially witnessing is an evolution in Bitcoin’s market positioning,” the co-founder told Cointelegraph, adding:
“Bitcoin’s fixed supply architecture inherently contrasts with fiat currencies that may face inflationary pressure under tariff-driven economic changes,” he added.

Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, marks their 50th birthday amid a year of rising institutional and geopolitical adoption of the world’s first cryptocurrency.
The identity of Nakamoto remains one of the biggest mysteries in crypto, with speculation ranging from cryptographers like Adam Back and Nick Szabo to broader theories involving government intelligence agencies.
While Nakamoto’s identity remains anonymous, the Bitcoin (BTC) creator is believed to have turned 50 on April 5 based on details shared in the past. 
According to archived data from his P2P Foundation profile, Nakamoto once claimed to be a 37-year-old man living in Japan and listed his birthdate as April 5, 1975.
Source: Web.archive.org
Nakamoto’s anonymity has played a vital role in maintaining the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network, which has no central authority or leadership.
The Bitcoin wallet associated with Nakamoto, which holds over 1 million BTC, has laid dormant for more than 16 years despite BTC rising from $0 to an all-time high above $109,000 in January.

Nakamoto’s 50th birthday comes nearly a month after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, marking the first major step toward integrating Bitcoin into the US financial system.

“At 50, Nakamoto’s legacy is no longer just code; it’s a cornerstone of economic sovereignty,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.
“Bitcoin’s reserve status signals trust in its scarcity and resilience,” Lian told Cointelegraph, adding: 
However, lingering questions about Nakamoto remain unanswered, including whether they still hold the keys to their wallet, which is “a fortune now tied to US policy,” Lian said.

In February, Arkham Intelligence published findings that attribute 1.096 million BTC — then valued at more than $108 billion — to Nakamoto. That would place him above Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on the global wealth rankings, according to data shared by Coinbase director Conor Grogan.

If accurate, this would make Nakamoto the world’s 16th richest person.

Bitcoin has shrugged off the market jitters caused by US President Donald Trump’s April 2 global tariff announcement. 
While BTC initially dropped over 3% to around $82,500, it eventually rebounded by roughly 4.5% to cross $84,700. In contrast, the S&P 500 plunged 10.65% this week, and gold—after hitting a record $3,167 on April 3—has slipped 4.8%.

The fresh divergence is fueling the “gold-leads-Bitcoin narrative,” taking cues from price trends from late 2018 through mid-2019 to predict a strong price recovery toward $100,000.
Gold began a steady ascent, gaining nearly 15% by mid-2019, while Bitcoin remained largely flat. Bitcoin's breakout followed shortly after, rallying over 170% in early 2019 and then surging another 344% by late 2020.

“A reclaim of $100k would imply a handoff from gold to BTC,” said market analyst MacroScope, adding:
The outlook aligned with Alpine Fox founder Mike Alfred, who shared an analysis from March 14, wherein he anticipated Bitcoin to grow 10 times or more than gold based on previous instances.

Bitcoin may be eyeing a drop toward $65,000, based on a bearish fractal playing out in the Bitcoin-to-gold (BTC/XAU) ratio. 
The BTC/XAU ratio is flashing a familiar pattern that traders last saw in 2021. The breakdown followed a second major support test at the 50-2W exponential moving average.

BTC/XAU is now repeating this fractal and once again testing the red 50-EMA as support.
In the previous cycle, Bitcoin consolidated around the same EMA level before breaking decisively lower, eventually finding support at the 200-2W EMA (the blue wave). If history repeats, BTC/XAU could be on track for a deeper correction, especially if macro conditions worsen.
Interestingly, these breakdown cycles have coincided with a drop in Bitcoin’s value in dollar terms, as shown below.

Should the fractal repeat, Bitcoin’s initial downside target could be its 50-2W EMA around the $65,000 level, with additional selloffs suggesting declines below $20,000, aligning with the 200-2W EMA. 
A bounce from BTC/XAU’s 50-2W EMA, on the other hand, may invalidate the bearish fractal.
From a fundamental perspective, Bitcoin’s price outlook appears skewed to the downside. 
Investors are concerned that President Donald Trump's global tariff war could spiral into a full-blown trade war and trigger a US recession. Risk assets like Bitcoin tend to underperform during economic contractions.

Further dampening sentiment, on April 4, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pushed back against expectations for near-term interest rate cuts.
Powell warned that inflation progress remains uneven, signaling a prolonged high-rate environment that may add more pressure to Bitcoin’s upside momentum.
Nonetheless, most bond traders see three consecutive rate cuts until the Fed’s September meeting, according to CME data.

Cryptocurrency firms felt the heat from US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff rollout this week as market turbulence sent share prices tumbling and foiled initial public offering (IPO) plans. 
From exchanges to Bitcoin (BTC) miners, crypto stocks suffered as much, if not more, than shares of other companies — despite the industry’s warm relationship with the US president. 
On April 2, Trump announced he was placing tariffs of at least 10% on practically all imports into the United States and adding additional ""reciprocal"" tariffs on some 57 countries. 
Since then, major US stock indices — including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq — tumbled by roughly 10% as traders braced for a looming trade war.

Crypto exchange Coinbase — a prominent ally of Trump during the November US elections — experienced a similarly severe sell-off, with its stock price dropping by roughly 12% during the same period, according to data from Google Finance.
Bitcoin miners are also taking a hit. The CoinShares Crypto Miners ETF (WGMI) — which tracks a diverse basket of Bitcoin mining stocks — has lost roughly 13% of its value since immediately prior to Trump’s April 2 announcement, according to data from Morningstar. 
Even Strategy, one of the best-performing stocks of 2024, wasn’t immune. Its share price has fallen by around 6% on the news, Google Finance data showed.
According to Reuters, investment bank JPMorgan has raised its estimated odds of a global economic recession in 2025 to 60% from 40% previously. 
""Disruptive U.S. policies have been recognized as the biggest risk to the global outlook all year,"" JP Morgan reportedly said.
""The effect ... is likely to be magnified through (tariff) retaliation, a slide in U.S. business sentiment and supply-chain disruptions.""

The impact of US tariffs hasn’t been limited to stock price volatility. Stablecoin issuer Circle has reportedly paused plans for a 2025 IPO, citing market turbulence. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, Circle is “waiting anxiously” before taking further steps after filing to take the company public on April 1. 
It is among several companies — including fintech Klarna and ticketing service StubHub — reportedly considering altering or shelving IPO plans. 
One exception may be Bitcoin itself, which some analysts say is finally “decoupling” from the broader market. 
Bitcoin’s spot price has held above $82,000 this week, even as US equities markets collapsed.

As stock markets crumbled for a second day on April 4, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the Trump administration’s “reciprocal tariffs” could significantly affect the economy, potentially leading to ""higher inflation and slower growth.""
Addressing the public at a conference on April 4, Powell maintained a cautious approach and noted that tariffs could spike inflation “in the coming quarters,” complicating the Fed’s 2% inflation target, just months after rate cuts indicated a soft landing. Powell said,
Moments before Powell’s speech, US President Donald Trump called out the Fed chair to “CUT INTEREST RATES” in a post on the Truth Social, taking a jab at Powell for being “always late.”

Currently, the Fed faces a critical choice: pause interest rate cuts throughout the year or respond quickly with rate reductions if the economy shows signs of weakening. While the Fed official noted that the economy is in a good place, Powell said that it was,  
On April 4, the unemployment rate also increased to 4.2% in March from 4.1% in February, but on the contrary, March’s Non-Farm Payrolls added 228,000 jobs, which exceeded expectations and reinforced economic strength. In March, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) also rose by 2.8% year over year, with March data due on April 10. 
The above figures highlight a strong labor market but nagging inflation concerns, thus aligning with Powell’s warning about potential tariff impacts.

Powell’s caution on higher inflation and slowing economic growth came on the same day that the DOW dropped 2,200 and a 10% two-day loss from the S&P 500. X-based markets resource ‘Watcher Guru’ announced that,

Most investors anticipate that in the short term, Bitcoin (BTC) could see a surge in volatility. Powell’s remarks about tariffs driving “higher inflation” and possibly “higher unemployment” could rattle traditional market investors, prompting a pivot to BTC.
In fact, analysts have pointed out that BTC price appears to be “decoupling” from stocks recent downturn. Although Bitcoin hit a 9-day high on April 2 before President Trump rolled out his “reciprocal tariffs” on “Liberation Day,” the price sold off sharply once the tariffs were revealed at a White House presser. 
Since then, Bitcoin has held steady above the $82,000 level, and as US equities markets collapsed on April 4, BTC rallied to $84,720, reflecting price action, which is uncharacteristic of the norm.

Independent market analyst Cory Bates posted the above chart and said, 
With China retaliating with 34% tariffs on US goods and Trump pressuring Powell to cut interest rates, market volatility could push Bitcoin’s price upward as a hedge against uncertainty. 
During the 2018 U.S.-China trade war, Bitcoin price didn’t see any increase across the entire year. However, it experienced notable volatility and a 15% price rise when the trade war escalated in mid-2018, with the US imposing tariffs on Chinese goods in July, followed by retaliatory measures from China.

85c187150ec8d78c364dc43d2c6cc9eb,Cointelegraph,Corporate Bitcoin treasuries drop more than $4B on US tariff hike impact,https://cointelegraph.com/news/corporate-bitcoin-treasuries-down-4b-us-tariff-hike-impact," Corporate Bitcoin holdings have sunk to about $54.5 billion from nearly $59 billion on April 2. 
Corporate Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries collectively shed more than $4 billion in value after US President Donald Trump’s tariffs triggered a global market sell-off, data shows. 
As of April 7, corporate Bitcoin holdings are worth approximately $54.5 billion in the aggregate, down from roughly $59 billion before April 2, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net.
The cryptocurrency’s volatility has also weighed on publicly traded Bitcoin holders’ share prices. 
The Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (OWNB) — an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking a diverse basket of corporate Bitcoin holders — has lost more than 13% since Trump announced sweeping US import tariffs on April 2, according to Yahoo Finance.
Even shares of Strategy — the de facto Bitcoin hedge fund founded by Michael Saylor that pioneered corporate Bitcoin buying — are down, clocking losses of more than 13% since April 2, Google Finance data showed. 
The losses highlight ongoing concerns about Bitcoin’s increasing popularity as a corporate treasury asset. Historically, corporate treasuries hold extremely low-risk assets like US Treasury Bills. 
“Cryptocurrencies' high volatility and uncertain regulatory landscape are misaligned with the fundamental goals of treasury management [such as] stability, liquidity, and capital preservation,” David Krause, a finance professor at Marquette University, said in a January research publication.

In 2024, surging Bitcoin prices pushed Strategy’s shares up more than 350%, according to data from FinanceCharts. 
Strategy’s success has inspired dozens of copycats, but investors are becoming skeptical.
In March, GameStop lost nearly $3 billion in market capitalization as shareholders second-guessed the videogame retailer’s plans to stockpile Bitcoin. 
“There are question marks with GameStop's model. If bitcoin is going to be the pivot, where does that leave everything else?” Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at eToro, told Reuters on March 27.

Still, adding Bitcoin to corporate treasuries can “potentially be a valuable hedge against growing fiscal deficits, currency debasement, and geopolitical risks,” asset manager Fidelity Digital Assets said in a 2024 report.
That thesis may already be playing out as Trump’s tariffs rattle markets, Binance said in an April 7 research report.  
“[I]n the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” Binance said.
Investors “will be watching closely to see if BTC is able to retain its appeal as a non-sovereign, permissionless asset in a protectionist global economy,” according to the report.

The cryptocurrency market erased all gains from President Trump’s US Crypto Strategic Reserve announcement, plunging by over 14.7% in seven days to reach $2.7 trillion on March 10.

Several factors have contributed to the latest drop in crypto prices, including:
Trump’s acknowledgement that his policies will cause short-term pain to the economy.
Investors are risk-off amid the continued outflows from crypto investment products.
TOTAL drops toward the technical target of a descending triangle.
President Trump’s recent statements have cast a shadow over the crypto market, tempering the enthusiasm that followed his pro-crypto rhetoric earlier in 2025. 
Key points:
Bitcoin  (BTC) declined 4% in the last 24 hours.
Ether (ETH) is down 3.2% over the last 24 hours to trade just above $2,000.
Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) have also recorded losses, down 7.2% and 4.5%, respectively.
Compounding the issue are the significant liquidations in the derivatives market. 
A total of $650.80 million in liquidations has been recorded in the past 24 hours.
Long positions took the hardest hit, with $595.75 million liquidated.

Bitcoin and Ethereum were the biggest casualties, with $264.22 million and $114.76 million in liquidations, respectively.
When long positions are liquidated, traders’ holdings are automatically sold, increasing market supply and driving prices lower.
More critically, US President Donald Trump acknowledged that markets could see short-term pain from his policies, including the trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China and budget-cutting plans.
“There could be a little disruption,"" said Trump in an interview with Fox News, adding:
The market, which surged post-election on hopes of a deregulated, crypto-friendly administration, is now grappling with the reality that Trump’s broader economic agenda may introduce headwinds before any crypto-specific benefits materialize.
The crypto market’s ongoing correction aligns with the huge capital outflows from crypto investment products. 
Key takeaways:
Digital asset investment products saw outflows for the fourth week in a row, totaling $876 million during the week ending March 7, as per CoinShares report.
This brings outflows to $4.75 billion in the last four weeks, reducing the year-to-date inflows to $2.6 billion.
This indicates institutional investors decreased their exposure to digital assets.
Bitcoin saw the biggest share of outflows, totaling $756 million.
Total assets under management have declined by $39 billion from their peak to the current value of $142 billion, the lowest point since mid-November 2024.

CoinShares head of research James Butterfill attributed this to “negative sentiment,” suggesting “capitulation” among investors.
Additionally, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plummeted to 10 on March 10, its lowest since July 2022, indicating “extreme fear.”

From a technical perspective, today’s crypto market’s decline is part of a correction trend that saw TOTAL—the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies—drop below a descending triangle pattern.
A descending triangle is a bearish continuation pattern, forming when the price makes lower highs while maintaining a flat support level at the bottom.
The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the support level with high volume and drops by as much as the triangle’s maximum height.
As of March 10, TOTAL had fallen to the pattern’s target of $2.6 trillion at the 50-weekly simple moving average (SMA).

If selling pressure persists, the 100–week SMA at $2 trillion could become the next downside target.
Holding the 50-week SMA as support may strengthen the ongoing rebound toward the pattern’s lower trendline, aligning with the $3.1 trillion level.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) 26.62%  decline from its $109,500 all-time high is en route to becoming the deepest drawdown of the current bull market cycle, according to CryptoQuant head of research, Julio Moreno.

Bitcoin has experienced significant drawdowns in past cycles, with a notable 83% drop from its peak in 2018 and a 73% correction from all-time highs (ATH) in 2022. In comparison, the current decline of 26.62%, while substantial, remains less severe than previous bear markets. 
This suggests that even though the current downturn is impactful, it has not yet reached the intensity of previous cycles. However, crypto and macro resource ‘ecoinometrics’ said that Bitcoin might struggle to stage an immediate turnaround. The analysts explained,

With the Nasdaq 100 currently flat year-on-year, Bitcoin’s price recovery might be difficult, even if the correction halts.
The recent Bitcoin (BTC) price drop also put Michael Saylor’s Strategy on the defensive, with the firm opting not to purchase any BTC for its treasury between March 31 and April 6. 
Additionally, data from Strategytracker highlighted that the corporation spent $35.65 billion on its Bitcoin holdings, currently reflecting a mere 17% return on a five-year holding period.

The immediate point of interest below the current price remains at $74,000, which was the early 2024 all-time high. However, the daily demand zone between $65,000 and $69,000 could be a bigger liquidity level based on its significance. The $69,000 level is also the 2021 all-time high price. 
Additionally, Bitcoin’s weekly relative strength index, RSI, reached its lowest value of 43 since January 2023 at the end of Q1. In August 2023 and September 2024, the RSI recovered from a similar value to trigger a price recovery for Bitcoin. In 2022, when RSI dropped below 40, bears took total control of the market.

Crypto’s worst quarter since the FTX crisis has many investors worried about the end of the bull market, but according to an industry panel, Bitcoin and altcoins’ parabolic moves haven’t even begun yet. 
In a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event in Paris, France, MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said he thinks the bull market is “actually getting started from this point.” 
While it’s hard to believe that following Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent plunge below $80,000 on global tariff woes, “we know from history” that chaotic sell-offs create favorable conditions for a reversal, he said.
Van de Poppe drew parallels between the current market dump and the COVID-19 crash in 2020, when Bitcoin plunged by nearly 40% in a single day.
“That was the actual bottom, and since then, Bitcoin went 20x,” said van de Poppe.

Messari CEO Eric Turner agreed, saying, “We never had a bull market,” but rather “two sides of the market.” 
“We had Bitcoin where all the flows went into [exchange-traded funds]” and “then you have pockets of things,” such as the memecoin frenzy and other short-term trends, he said.
“I actually think the real question is, when does the bull market come? If you ask me, that’s going to be Q3, Q4 of this year,” said Turner.
Beyond short-term price action, it helps to look at the big picture, especially in the United States, said John Patrick Mullin, the co-founder and CEO of Mantra. Mullin said he’s “excited” about all of the favorable policy tailwinds coming from the United States, including the Executive Branch.

US President Donald Trump is overseeing an overhaul of crypto regulations in Washington, with lawmakers moving closer to passing landmark stablecoin and market structure bills. 
Trump has also appointed pro-crypto leaders to various positions, chief among them being Paul Atkins, who recently moved one step closer to securing the nomination as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
However, these positive developments have failed to kickstart the bull market or bring meaningful capital flows into the industry, largely because Trump’s other agenda items — namely, tackling perceived trade imbalances — have triggered growth fears. 
Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2 were perceived by many investors as an egregious attempt to rewrite the terms of global trade, as they went beyond the 10% universal tariff proposed initially.

The tariff announcement triggered the largest exodus from US stocks since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
However, if past crises like COVID-19 are anything to go by, the US Federal Reserve will likely step in at some point to backstop the market should things get progressively worse.
“[...] If you go back in time with another crisis and at some point the Fed steps in to lower the rates and to print money to stimulate the internal economy,” van de Poppe said during the panel discussion.
“So, it’s going to happen. The question is when,” said van de Poppe.

Bitcoin (BTC) is showing “signs of resilience” even as stocks and the broader cryptocurrency market plunge amid a global market sell-off after US President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on US imports last week, Binance Research said. 
As of mid-day trading on April 7, Bitcoin is up almost 1% to nearly $79,000. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 — an index of large US stocks — is essentially flat and front-month gold futures are down around 1.5%, according to Google Finance.
“Even in the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, said in an April 7 research report.  
Notably, Bitcoin’s supply of long-term holders continues to rise, “reflecting conviction and limited capitulation during recent volatility,” Binance said.
On April 2, Trump said he was putting tariffs of at least 10% on most imports into the United States and adding additional ""reciprocal"" tariffs on goods from 57 countries. 
Since then, major US stock indexes — including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq — dropped by more than 10% as traders braced for a looming trade war. 
Bitcoin is still down more than stocks — about 12% — but has held up better than crypto’s overall market capitalization, which is down roughly 25% since April 2. 
“Now, with reciprocal tariffs emerging and global markets adjusting to the prospect of prolonged trade fragmentation, much could hinge on BTC’s ability to reassert its safe haven narrative,” the report said.

Bitcoin’s correlation with gold — historically considered the ultimate safe haven asset during times of extreme macroeconomic uncertainty — has been low, averaging around 0.12 over the past 90 days, Binance said. 
The cryptocurrency has a closer correlation with equities of 0.32. However, “despite short-term swings, BTC may still have room to reassert a more independent macro identity,” according to the exchange. 
“The key question is whether BTC can return to its long-term pattern of low correlation with equities,” noted the report. 
Source: Binance Research
For now, gold appears to be the preferred safe haven asset among fund managers, Binance said. 
It cited a survey in which 58% of respondents said they would prefer to hold gold during a trade war versus only 3% for Bitcoin. 
“Market participants will be watching closely to see if BTC is able to retain its appeal as a non-sovereign, permissionless asset in a protectionist global economy,” Binance said.

Update April 4, 10:40 am UTC: This article has been updated to insert comments from Bitlayer co-founder Kevin He. 
More than $21 million worth of Bitcoin was unstaked from the Babylon protocol in the 24 hours after the platform’s token airdrop, according to blockchain data shared by a developer.
On April 4, Bitfeed developer Mononaut shared that in the previous 24 hours, 256 Bitcoin (BTC) had been unstaked from the staking protocol. Mononaut said that the unstaking transactions paid 1.35 BTC in fees and consumed 1.318 Megavirtualbytes (MvB) of blockspace. This means the transactions generated high fees and occupied roughly a third of an entire Bitcoin block. 
The activity followed Babylon’s 600 million airdrop of its native token, BABY, which was distributed to early users and contributors.

In a previous Cointelegraph interview, Babylon co-founder Fisher Yu said that, unlike Ethereum and Solana, Bitcoin staking does not reward stakers in the chain’s native asset. Instead, they may get rewards in the form of the native token of the blockchain secured by the staked Bitcoin capital. 
On April 3, the Babylon Foundation announced the details of the airdrop program for its early adopters. The protocol said the airdrop was dedicated to its Phase 1 stakers, non-fungible token (NFT) holders and developers contributing to its ecosystem. 
The staking protocol said it was airdropping 600 million BABY tokens, 6% of its total supply; 30 million BABY were allocated to the protocol’s Pioneer Pass NFT holders, while 5 million BABY were slated for open-source contributors. 
The rest of the tokens were to be distributed among eligible stakers who participated in the protocol’s Phase 1. This included a stake participation airdrop of 30 million BABY, a base staking reward airdrop of 335 million BABY and a bonus staking reward airdrop for Phase 2 transition of 200 million BABY.  
While the platform distributed an airdrop for its early adopters, it clarified that it did not include wallet campaigns and liquid staking incentives in this airdrop event. 
In response to the airdrop, crypto exchange OKX listed the BABY token and USDT pair in pre-market futures. Pre-market futures allow traders to speculate on an asset’s future price. This allows investors to trade BABY futures before the asset becomes available in spot markets.
Even though millions in BTC were unstaked after the airdrop, the effect may be minimal. Bitlayer co-founder Kevin He told Cointelegraph this was “common short-term market behavior.” 
The executive said this simply represents early redemption. Furthermore, He said the high transaction fees stem from Babylon’s initial design and do not impact its long-term value. 
He added that Babylon garnered significant attention with its tokenomics and airdrop, which boosts community engagement. The executive said the protocol plays a “key role” in Bitcoin DeFi, pushing Bitcoin beyond being simply a store of value. 
Data platform DefiLlama shows that Babylon currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $4.29 billion. This represents 80% of the Bitcoin ecosystem’s overall TVL of $5.34 billion.
