13bb70cf1e366fa890e4cab6a955bb4c,Cointelegraph,European lawmakers silent on US Bitcoin reserve amid digital euro push,https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-lawmakers-silent-trump-bitcoin-reserve-amid-cbdc-push," European lawmakers have yet to respond to Trump’s Bitcoin reserve order as the ECB pushes ahead with its digital euro plans for an October 2025 launch. 
European lawmakers have remained silent on the United States’ Strategic Bitcoin Reserve order, a landmark policy shift favoring early adopters of Bitcoin due to its economic model.
US President Donald Trump’s March 7 executive order outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency seized in criminal cases rather than purchasing Bitcoin (BTC) on the market.
Despite the significance of this move, European policymakers have yet to make any major public statements regarding Bitcoin reserves, raising questions about their stance on integrating BTC into national reserves.
This may signal a lack of European Bitcoin reserve-related efforts due to the lengthy process of adding new national reserve assets, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum. She said:
“[The] ECB [European Central Bank] historically and currently is very critical of BTC as a reserve asset, so it effectively closes the doors to all EU member states,” Plotnikova added.
Meanwhile, European lawmakers are preparing to launch the digital euro, a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

European lawmakers’ silence on Trump’s Bitcoin reserve order is likely due to its focus on the digital euro, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of venture capital firm DFG.
“This stems from the ECB’s firm stance against holding Bitcoin in its reserves, as reiterated by ECB President Christine Lagarde,” Wo told Cointelegraph, adding:

Despite skepticism, ECB President Christine Lagarde is pushing ahead with the digital euro’s rollout, expected in October 2025. Lagarde has emphasized that the CBDC will coexist with cash and offer privacy protections to address concerns about government overreach.
“The European Union is looking to launch the digital euro, our central bank digital currency, by October this year,” Lagarde said during a press conference, adding:

The United States and the European Union are taking opposite approaches to digital assets. While the EU is working to integrate a centralized digital currency, Trump has taken a firm stance against CBDCs.
While CBDCs have been praised for their potential to increase financial inclusion, critics have raised concerns about their surveillance capabilities and the potential for government overreach.
In July 2023, Brazil’s central bank published the source code for its CBDC pilot, and it took just four days for people to notice the surveillance and control mechanisms embedded within its code, allowing the central bank to freeze or reduce user funds within CBDC wallets.

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

94c12da125c5bf8e30117dbf94629660,Cointelegraph,Why is the crypto market down today?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-down-today," The cryptocurrency market is down today as investors view crypto products funds outflows and Trump’s policies as cues for bearish market momentum. 
The cryptocurrency market erased all gains from President Trump’s US Crypto Strategic Reserve announcement, plunging by over 14.7% in seven days to reach $2.7 trillion on March 10.

Several factors have contributed to the latest drop in crypto prices, including:
Trump’s acknowledgement that his policies will cause short-term pain to the economy.
Investors are risk-off amid the continued outflows from crypto investment products.
TOTAL drops toward the technical target of a descending triangle.
President Trump’s recent statements have cast a shadow over the crypto market, tempering the enthusiasm that followed his pro-crypto rhetoric earlier in 2025. 
Key points:
Bitcoin  (BTC) declined 4% in the last 24 hours.
Ether (ETH) is down 3.2% over the last 24 hours to trade just above $2,000.
Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) have also recorded losses, down 7.2% and 4.5%, respectively.
Compounding the issue are the significant liquidations in the derivatives market. 
A total of $650.80 million in liquidations has been recorded in the past 24 hours.
Long positions took the hardest hit, with $595.75 million liquidated.

Bitcoin and Ethereum were the biggest casualties, with $264.22 million and $114.76 million in liquidations, respectively.
When long positions are liquidated, traders’ holdings are automatically sold, increasing market supply and driving prices lower.
More critically, US President Donald Trump acknowledged that markets could see short-term pain from his policies, including the trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China and budget-cutting plans.
“There could be a little disruption,"" said Trump in an interview with Fox News, adding:
The market, which surged post-election on hopes of a deregulated, crypto-friendly administration, is now grappling with the reality that Trump’s broader economic agenda may introduce headwinds before any crypto-specific benefits materialize.
The crypto market’s ongoing correction aligns with the huge capital outflows from crypto investment products. 
Key takeaways:
Digital asset investment products saw outflows for the fourth week in a row, totaling $876 million during the week ending March 7, as per CoinShares report.
This brings outflows to $4.75 billion in the last four weeks, reducing the year-to-date inflows to $2.6 billion.
This indicates institutional investors decreased their exposure to digital assets.
Bitcoin saw the biggest share of outflows, totaling $756 million.
Total assets under management have declined by $39 billion from their peak to the current value of $142 billion, the lowest point since mid-November 2024.

CoinShares head of research James Butterfill attributed this to “negative sentiment,” suggesting “capitulation” among investors.
Additionally, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plummeted to 10 on March 10, its lowest since July 2022, indicating “extreme fear.”

From a technical perspective, today’s crypto market’s decline is part of a correction trend that saw TOTAL—the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies—drop below a descending triangle pattern.
A descending triangle is a bearish continuation pattern, forming when the price makes lower highs while maintaining a flat support level at the bottom.
The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the support level with high volume and drops by as much as the triangle’s maximum height.
As of March 10, TOTAL had fallen to the pattern’s target of $2.6 trillion at the 50-weekly simple moving average (SMA).

If selling pressure persists, the 100–week SMA at $2 trillion could become the next downside target.
Holding the 50-week SMA as support may strengthen the ongoing rebound toward the pattern’s lower trendline, aligning with the $3.1 trillion level.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the world’s largest public corporate Bitcoin holder, is looking to raise up to $21 billion in fresh capital to purchase more BTC.
On March 10, Strategy officially announced that it entered into a new sales agreement that would allow the firm to issue and sell shares of its 8% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock to raise funds for general corporate purposes, including potential Bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions.
As part of the agreement deal, dubbed the “ATM Program,” Strategy expects to make sales “in a disciplined manner over an extended period,” taking into account the trading price and volumes of the perpetual strike preferred stock at the time of sale.
“Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the ATM Program for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital,” the firm said in the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The announcement comes amid Strategy holding 499,096 BTC ($41.2 billion), which it acquired for an aggregate amount of $33.1 billion at an average price of $66,423 per BTC.
The company previously disclosed plans to issue and sell shares of its class A common stock to raise up to $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities over the next three years in order to accumulate more Bitcoin under its “21/21 plan.”
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

f21e65fcd2f2b1cf8ba74d75c8c10d91,Cointelegraph,Singapore Exchange to list Bitcoin futures in H2 2025: Report,https://cointelegraph.com/news/singapore-exchange-bitcoin-futures-second-half-2025," Futures have emerged as a growing crypto trend, with major global groups, such as SGX and Japan’s Osaka Dojima, reportedly looking to introduce Bitcoin futures in 2025. 
Singapore Exchange (SGX), the largest exchange group in Singapore, reportedly plans to debut Bitcoin perpetual futures in the second half of 2025.
SGX is working to introduce Bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures for institutional and professional investors in an effort to “expand institutional market access,” Bloomberg reported on March 10.
A spokesperson at SGX reportedly said that the company expects to offer a trusted alternative for trading cryptocurrency futures, with its Aa2 rating by Moody’s.
Strictly restricting retail investors, SGX’s planned Bitcoin products are awaiting approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the report stated.
Bitcoin futures fall under the category of cryptocurrency derivatives, which offer investors the ability to trade on the value derived from the price of an underlying cryptocurrency and speculate on future price movements without holding the asset.
Crypto futures allow investors to speculate on the price by a certain date and time, while perpetual futures offer no expiration date.
The potential arrival of perpetual Bitcoin futures to SGX comes amid Singapore becoming a global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain acceptance, with the MAS adopting crypto-friendly regulations and doubling the number of crypto licenses in 2024.
According to Bloomberg, SGX is not the only exchange seeking the launch of Bitcoin futures trading in Singapore.
EDX Markets, a crypto asset firm backed by Citadel Securities, reportedly announced plans to offer crypto futures in the city-state in January 2025.

On March 4, Bloomberg News also reported that Japan’s Osaka Dojima Exchange — a Japanese-listed derivatives exchange — was also looking for approval to list Bitcoin futures in Japan.
If approved, Dojima could become one of the first traditional exchanges in Asia to handle Bitcoin futures.
Cointelegraph approached SGX and the MAS for a comment regarding the potential introduction of Bitcoin perpetual futures on the exchange but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

Software intelligence firm turned Bitcoin investment behemoth Strategy remains $7.8 billion in profit on its Bitcoin holdings despite the cryptocurrency’s recent drop to $80,000.
On March 10, Bitcoin (BTC) recorded its largest weekly decline on record, shedding more value in the past seven days than at any other time in its trading history. Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows that BTC went from $93,379 on March 3 to a low of $80,610 on March 10, a 13.6% drop in Bitcoin prices in one week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin had recovered slightly to trade at around $82,000. 
Despite the market downturn, Michael Saylor’s Strategy remained ahead on its BTC purchases. The company held 499,096 BTC, purchased at an average of $66,423 per token. In total, Strategy has spent $33.1 billion on Bitcoin purchases, while its holdings are now valued at $41.2 billion — a 24% unrealized gain even amid the correction.
Strategy’s Bitcoin investments highlight the importance of the dollar-cost averaging tactic in investing. Instead of buying at a lump sum, the company divided its BTC purchases at different times and continued to buy the tokens despite the prices. 
While Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings remain in the green, other companies that recently entered the Bitcoin market are seeing losses.
According to Bitcoin holdings tracker BitcoinTreasuries.NET, healthcare tech and software firm Semler Scientific, which started holding BTC on May 28, is down by 6.25% on its purchases. 
The company holds 3,192 BTC bought at an average price of $87,850. This means that its BTC purchased with over $280 million is now only worth around $262 million.

Metaplanet, dubbed “Asia’s Strategy,” is slightly down on its Bitcoin holdings. The company started to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet in April 2023, copying Strategy’s playbook. 
Metaplanet holds 2,888 bought at an average price of $83,049. It’s down by over $2 million, nearly 1%, on its Bitcoin investments. 
According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, Strategy has spent $23 billion on Bitcoin purchases since November 2024. However, with the recent price drop, the BTC acquired during this period is now worth only about $20 billion, implying an unrealized loss of over $3 billion on these recent acquisitions.

Cryptocurrency companies spent more than $134 million on the 2024 US elections, fueling concerns about their growing political influence and potential risks to regulatory stability, according to a report by the Center for Political Accountability (CPA).
The growing connection of crypto firms with US politics is raising newfound concerns for regulators, investors and the wider financial system, according to a report released by the Center for Political Accountability (CPA).
Cryptocurrency firms shelled out a cumulative $134 million on the 2024 US elections in “unchecked political spending,” which presents some critical challenges, the March 7 report stated.
“While the companies making these contributions may be seeking a favorable regulatory environment, these political donations further erode public trust and expose companies to legal, reputational, and business risks that cannot be ignored,” the report added.
Cryptocurrency regulation has taken center stage over the past week following a historic executive order from US President Donald Trump to create a Strategic Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve ahead of the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7.

Fairshake, a political action committee (PAC) backed by major crypto firms including Coinbase, Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz, was one of the largest contributors, spending more than $40 million to support candidates aligned with pro-crypto policies.
Fairshake and affiliated PACs were active in key congressional races, attempting to shape legislation favorable to digital assets.
“As the industry continues to seek influence through vast contributions and opaque financial maneuvers, the risks of instability, regulatory backlash, and public distrust only grow,” the report said.

The influx of crypto money into politics did not go unnoticed by regulators. In August 2024, the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), alleging that Coinbase’s corporate contributions to Fairshake and the Congressional Leadership Fund constituted a violation of federal election law due to their status as a federal contractor.

“The stakes are too high for us to stand on the sidelines, and that’s why we at Coinbase are proud to help do our part,” the company wrote in an October 2024 blog post.

Despite the risks highlighted by the report, some regulatory experts see the donations as necessary for advancing more innovation-friendly regulations.
“As someone deeply involved in crypto, I see this spending as necessary for regulatory clarity, crucial for stability and growth,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert:
Still, risks, including “regulatory capture,” where the interests of large firms take priority, may present challenges and erode crypto investor trust. Still, this is part of the organic growth of the emerging crypto industry, Lian said, adding:
The debate over crypto’s role in politics follows the high-profile collapse of the Libra (LIBRA) token, a memecoin endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei. The project’s insiders allegedly siphoned over $107 million worth of liquidity in a rug pull, triggering a 94% price collapse within hours and wiping out $4 billion.
Over 100 governmental fraud complaints have been opened in Argentina since the Libra memecoin’s scandal, illustrating the risks of a country’s executive branch promoting “any kind of unregulated security,” the CPA’s report states.

While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index continues to show “extreme fear” on March 10, one BTC market simulation still highlights bullish projections for the latter half of 2025. 
Mark Quant, a crypto researcher, performed a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze Bitcoin's price, providing a six-month forecast for the crypto asset.
The Monte Carlo model is a computational method using random sampling to simulate price projections and assess risk. It can generate multiple possible scenarios based on variable factors such as volatility and market trends. 
Bitcoin Monte Carlo projections by Mark Quant. Source: X.com
Based on the initial price of $82,655, the study estimated a mean final price of $258,445 by the end of September 2025. However, on a broader scale, the price was expected to fluctuate between $51,430, i.e., a 5th percentile return and $713,000 at the 95th percentile.  
Related: Bitcoin slides another 3% — Is BTC price headed for $69K next?
However, it is important to note that a Monte Carlo model relies strongly on the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model, which assumes that the asset value follows a random path with a constant parameter drift. 
In this analysis, Bitcoin's inherent volatility is built into the model, capturing long-term historical performance and patterns while adapting to future shifts. Essentially, the Monte Carlo analysis remains as fitting as “rolling the dice.""
Last week, Quant also highlighted a correlation between the total crypto market cap and the global liquidity index, indicating that the TOTAL market cap value may reach new highs above $4 trillion in Q2 2025. 
Bitcoin price dropped 6.38% over the weekend, creating a fresh CME futures gap in the charts. The CME Bitcoin futures gap describes the price difference between the closing of CME Bitcoin futures trading on Friday and its reopening on Sunday evening.

Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded a fourth straight week of outflows, with $876 million in losses during the past trading week.
After posting record weekly outflows of $2.9 billion last week, crypto ETPs continued their downward trend, bringing the four-week total outflows to $4.75 billion, CoinShares reported on March 10.
While the pace of outflows slowed, investor sentiment remained bearish, according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.
The analyst also suggested that the market has shown signs of capitulation.
Bitcoin (BTC) ETPs were the primary driver of outflows, accounting for $756 million, or 85% of last week’s total. Short-Bitcoin ETPs also saw outflows of $19.8 million, the most since December 2024. 
With cumulative outflows reaching $4.75 billion over the past four weeks, the year-to-date inflows dropped to $2.6 billion.

Total assets under management (AUM) declined by $39 billion to $142 billion, the lowest point since mid-November 2024, driven by both negative price movements and sustained outflows, Butterfill noted.
This bearish sentiment was also observed among a wide range of altcoins last week, with Ether (ETH) ETPs seeing $89 million of outflows.
Tron (TRX) and Aave (AAVE) were also among the most notable ETP losers, seeing $32 million and $2.4 million in outflows, respectively, according to the report.

Conversely, Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Sui (SUI) continued to see inflows totaling $16.4 million, $5.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, Butterfill wrote.
Among crypto ETP issuers, Fidelity Investments saw the largest outflows last week at $201 million, bringing its YTD outflows to $159 million.
BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded funds (ETF) were the second largest loser, with weekly outflows amounting to $193 million.

Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) announced on March 10 that it had received the nod from Spain’s securities regulator, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), to offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) trading services to its customers. 
Spain’s second-largest bank’s crypto offerings in Spain will enable users to buy, sell and manage digital assets through its mobile app. The lender said it will use its own cryptographic key custody platform to maintain full control over customer holdings without third-party involvement. 
Initially, the rollout will be limited to a select group of users before gradually expanding to all private customers across the Iberian nation in the coming months.

BBVA’s foray into crypto began in Switzerland, where it launched Bitcoin custody and trading services for private banking clients in June 2021. The Swiss branch has since broadened its offerings to include Ether and the USDC (USDC) stablecoin.
In January 2025, BBVA’s Turkish subsidiary Garanti BBVA Kripto launched its crypto trading services to the public. With Spain now entering the fold, BBVA is broadening its crypto services in line with evolving European regulations.
BBVA’s expansion comes as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) reached full implementation at the end of 2024. While the framework is now in effect, crypto companies in the EU have until July 2026 to fully comply with its requirements under an 18-month transitional phase.

Since MiCA’s rollout, traditional finance firms have accelerated their efforts to secure MiCA licenses and integrate crypto services. Prime brokerage Hidden Road obtained its MiCA license in the Netherlands on Dec. 30, 2024. Standard Chartered followed on Jan. 9, receiving approval in Luxembourg, while Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody became Germany’s first MiCA-licensed crypto service provider on Jan. 17.
Crypto-native companies are also adjusting to the new regulatory landscape. In January 2025, major exchanges OKX, Crypto.com and HashKey all secured MiCA approval. Bybit, which suffered the largest hack in crypto history, was recently removed from France’s blacklist and has expressed intent to obtain a MiCA license next.
