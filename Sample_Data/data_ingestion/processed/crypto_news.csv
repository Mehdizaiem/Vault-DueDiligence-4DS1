c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

4d7a62e1e416df31f170b394bef04ff2,Cointelegraph,Rare market volatility signal points to higher Bitcoin price in 6 to 12 months — Dan Tapiero,https://cointelegraph.com/news/rare-market-volatility-signal-points-to-higher-bitcoin-price-in-6-to-12-months-dan-tapiero," Analysts have conflicting views on whether record volatility within the US equities markets will have a positive or negative impact on Bitcoin price in the long term. 
On April 7, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) posted a rare spike to 60, a level seen as a barometer of extreme market fear and uncertainty. According to Dan Tapiero, CEO of 10Tfund, the VIX has hit 60 only five times in the last 35 years, and data suggests a rebound for risk assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) in 6 to 12 months. 
The VIX, which is widely considered a ""fear gauge,"" reflects investor expectations of market turbulence based on S&P 500 options trading. As illustrated in the chart, extreme spikes were seen in 2008 and 2020, typically coinciding with market bottoms, where panic-driven sellers paved the way for generational market entries. 
In light of that, Tapiero argued that the current spike is no different, with the worst of market fears likely ""priced in,"" setting the stage for a positive future. Tapiero said that “odds favor better future.”  
Likewise, Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), supported Tapiero’s claim and said that tech stocks are at their most oversold since the COVID-19 crash, with over 55% of Nasdaq 100 stocks posting a 14-day RSI below 30. Such a market signal has occurred only during major crises like the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
Bittel explained that after the VIX touched 60 last week, it implied peak uncertainty, which breeds fear in investors’ minds. Briefly touching on the US Investors Intelligence Survey, Bittel compared the current bullish sentiment of 23.6% to the lowest reading since December 2008. 
Additionally, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) survey respondents are currently 62% bearish, reflecting the highest bearish reading since March 2009. Bittel said,
This widespread fear, alongside a rare VIX spike, sets up for market entries in assets like Bitcoin, as the recovery of market liquidity will inevitably flow back into risk-on assets.

While macroeconomic experts highlighted the possibility of a bullish outcome for risk assets, markets analyst Tony Severino suggested that the Bitcoin/VIX ratio might also lead to a bear market. In a recent X post, Severino predicted that Bitcoin could have already peaked this cycle, but remained open about a possible change in opinion by the end of April. 
As illustrated in the chart, Severino noted a sell signal at the beginning of January. The analyst used the Elliott Wave theory model to pinpoint the current bearish conditions and said that it is still early to say that Bitcoin will turn bullish based on the VIX correlation.

b8941102d9c42e3fd988e85fd81e600d,Cointelegraph,"Price predictions 4/18: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, LEO, LINK, AVAX",https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-predictions-4-18-btc-eth-xrp-bnb-sol-doge-ada-leo-link-avax," Bitcoin trades in a tightening range, signalling that range expansion is likely to occur in the near future. 
Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight range for a few days, but a minor positive is that the bulls have kept the price above $83,000. Usually, a low volatility period is followed by a range expansion, but it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty.
Cryptocurrency analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s prospects because gold’s rally in 2017 and 2020 was followed by a sharp rise in Bitcoin's price. Theya head of growth Joe Consorti said in a post on X that Bitcoin follows gold with a lag of roughly 100 to 150 days. 
If Bitcoin moves as per Consorti’s expectations, a new all-time high could be hit between Q3 and Q4 of 2025. On similar lines, trading and analytics account Cryptollica projected a medium-term target of $155,000 for Bitcoin.
Along with Bitcoin, analysts are also bullish on altcoins. Swiss bank Sygnum said in its Q2 2025 investment outlook that improved regulations for crypto use cases have prepared the ground for a strong altcoins rally in the second quarter, as “none of the positive developments have been priced in.”
Could Bitcoin and the altcoins break above their respective overhead resistance levels and start a recovery? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
Bitcoin has been trading between the 20-day exponential moving average ($83,463) and the 200-day simple moving average ($87,857), indicating a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.
If the 20-day EMA cracks, the selling could pick up, and the BTC/USDT pair may slide to $78,500 and then to $73,777. Buyers are expected to defend the $73,777 level with all their might because a break below it may signal the start of a downtrend.
On the contrary, a break and close above the 200-day SMA indicates that the corrective phase may be over. The pair could climb to $95,000 and eventually to the psychologically critical level of $100,000.
Ether (ETH) has been trading between the $1,368 support and the $1,754 resistance, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.
The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest a slight edge to the sellers. If the price slips below $1,471, the ETH/USDT pair could descend to $1,368. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $1,368 support because a break below it may sink the pair to $1,150.
On the upside, the bulls are likely to face stiff resistance in the zone between the 20-day EMA ($1,676) and $1,754. A break and close above the resistance zone could propel the pair to the breakdown level of $2,111.
The bears have failed to sink XRP (XRP) below the $2 support, suggesting a lack of selling pressure at lower levels.
The bulls will try to start a recovery, which could reach the 50-day SMA ($2.23). This is an essential short-term level to keep an eye on because a break above it opens the doors for a rally to the resistance line. Buyers will have to push the price above the resistance line to signal a short-term trend change.
Alternatively, a break below the $2 support tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The XRP/USDT pair could then plunge to the $1.72 to $1.61 support zone.
BNB (BNB) has been trading just below the downtrend line, indicating that the bulls have held on to their positions as they anticipate a breakout.
If buyers propel the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $644. Sellers will try to defend the $644 resistance, but the bulls are expected to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA ($588). If that happens, the likelihood of a rally to $680 increases.
This optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down from the downtrend line and breaks below $566. That could keep the pair stuck inside the triangle for some more time.
Solana (SOL) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($126) on April 16 and rose above the 50-day SMA ($130), indicating buying on dips.
The SOL/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $153, where the bears are expected to mount a stiff resistance. If buyers pierce the $153 level, the pair could surge toward $180.
Buyers are expected to guard the zone between the 20-day EMA and $120. If the zone gives way, it suggests that the bears are active at higher levels. The pair could then descend to the $110 support.
Dogecoin (DOGE) has been trading between the 20-day EMA ($0.16) and the crucial support at $0.14 for the past few days.
The flattening 20-day EMA and the positive divergence on the RSI suggest reduced selling pressure. Buyers will have to drive the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.17) to gain the upper hand. The DOGE/USDT pair could climb to $0.20, an essential level to watch out for as a break above it completes a double bottom pattern.
Contrarily, a break and close below the $0.14 support signals the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The pair could then plummet to $0.10.
Buyers have kept Cardano (ADA) above the $0.59 support but are struggling to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.63).
If the price turns down and breaks below $0.59, the ADA/USDT pair could slide toward the solid support at $0.50. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it signals the resumption of the downtrend. The next support on the downside is at $0.40.
Buyers will be back in the driver’s seat on a break and close above the 50-day SMA ($0.70). The pair could then rally to $0.83.

UNUS SED LEO’s (LEO) failure to rise above the uptrend line may have tempted short-term buyers to book profits.
The 20-day EMA ($9.34) has started to turn down gradually, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling a slight edge to the bears. If the price tumbles below the immediate support at $8.95, the LEO/USD pair could retest the vital level at $8.79. A break below $8.79 could sink the pair to $8.30.
This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price rises above the 50-day SMA ($9.56). The pair could then retest the stiff overhead resistance at $9.90. 
Chainlink (LINK) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($12.77), but the bears have failed to pull the price below $11.68, signaling a lack of sellers at lower levels.
The bulls will try to push the price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $16. Sellers will try to halt the rally at $16, but the pair could reach the resistance line if the bulls prevail.
If sellers want to retain the advantage, they will have to sink the price below the $11.68 support. The pair could then decline to the support line of the descending channel, which is likely to attract buyers.
Avalanche (AVAX) has been trading near the moving averages, indicating a balance between supply and demand.
The flattish 20-day EMA ($18.97) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. A break above the downtrend line could open the doors for a rally to the overhead resistance at $23.50. Buyers will have to overcome this barrier to start a new up move.
On the downside, a break and close below $17.50 may sink the AVAX/USDT pair to $15.27. This is an essential level for the bulls to defend, as a break below $15.27 may signal the resumption of the downtrend.

Crypto investor sentiment took another significant hit this week after Mantra’s OM token collapsed by over 90% within hours on Sunday, April 13, triggering knee-jerk comparisons to previous black swan events such as the Terra-Luna collapse.
Elsewhere, Coinbase’s report for institutional investors added to concerns by highlighting that cryptocurrencies may be in a bear market until a recovery occurs in the third quarter of 2025.
Mantra’s recent token collapse highlights an issue within the crypto industry of fluctuating weekend liquidity levels creating additional downside volatility, which may have exacerbated the token’s crash.
The Mantra (OM) token’s price collapsed by over 90% on Sunday, April 13, from roughly $6.30 to below $0.50, triggering market manipulation allegations among disillusioned investors, Cointelegraph reported.
While blockchain analysts are still piecing together the reasons behind the OM collapse, the event highlights some crucial issues for the crypto industry, according to Gracy Chen, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitget.
“The OM token crash exposed several critical issues that we are seeing not just in OM, but also as an industry,” Chen said during Cointelegraph’s Chainreaction daily X show, adding:

A monthly market review by publicly traded US-based crypto exchange Coinbase shows that while the crypto market has contracted, it appears to be gearing up for a better quarter.
According to Coinbase’s April 15 monthly outlook for institutional investors, the altcoin market cap shrank by 41% from its December 2024 highs of $1.6 trillion to $950 billion by mid-April. BTC Tools data shows that this metric touched a low of $906.9 billion on April 9 and stood at $976.9 billion at the time of writing.
Venture capital funding to crypto projects has reportedly decreased by 50%–60% from 2021–22. In the report, Coinbase’s global head of research, David Duong, highlighted that a new crypto winter may be upon us.
“Several converging signals may be pointing to the start of a new ‘crypto winter’ as some extreme negative sentiment has set in due to the onset of global tariffs and the potential for further escalations,” he said.

Manta Network co-founder Kenny Li said he was targeted by a sophisticated phishing attack on Zoom that used live recordings of familiar people in an attempt to lure him to download malware. 
The meeting seemed real with the impersonated person’s camera on, but the lack of sound and a suspicious prompt to download a script raised red flags, Li said in an April 17 X post.
“I could see their legit faces. Everything looked very real. But I couldn’t hear them. It said my Zoom needs an update. But it asked me to download a script file. I immediately left.”
Li then asked the impersonator to verify themselves over a Telegram call, however, they didn’t comply and proceeded to erase all messages and block him soon after.
Li said the North Korean state-backed Lazarus Group was behind the attack.
The Manta Network co-founder managed to screenshot his conversation with the attacker before the messages were deleted, during which Li initially suggested moving the call over to Google Meet.
Speaking with Cointelegraph, Li said he believed the live shots used in the video call were taken from past recordings of real team members.
“It didn’t seem AI-generated. The quality looked like what a typical webcam quality looks like.”

The cryptocurrency market is still recycling old narratives, with few new trends yet to emerge and replace the leading themes in the first quarter of 2025.
Artificial intelligence tokens and memecoins were the dominant crypto narratives in the first quarter of 2025, accounting for 62.8% of investor interest, according to a quarterly research report by CoinGecko. AI tokens captured 35.7% of global investor interest, overtaking the 27.1% share of memecoins, which remained in second place.
Out of the top 20 crypto narratives of the quarter, six were memecoin categories while five were AI-related.
“Seems like we have yet to see another new narrative emerge and we are still following past quarters’ trends,” said Bobby Ong, the co-founder and chief operating officer of CoinGecko, in an April 17 X post. “I guess we are all tired from the same old trends repeating themselves.”

The crypto lending market’s size remains significantly down from its $64 billion high, but decentralized finance (DeFi) borrowing has made a more than 900% recovery from bear market lows.
Crypto lending enables borrowers to use their crypto holdings as collateral to obtain crypto or fiat loans, while lenders can use their holdings to generate interest.
The crypto lending market was down over 43%, from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021 to $36.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a Galaxy Digital research report published on April 14.
“The decline can be attributed to the decimation of lenders on the supply side and funds, individuals, and corporate entities on the demand side,” according to Zack Pokorny, research associate at Galaxy Digital.
The decline in the crypto lending market started in 2022 when centralized finance (CeFi) lenders Genesis, Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager filed for bankruptcy within two years as crypto valuations fell.
Their collective downfall led to an estimated 78% collapse in the size of the lending market, with CeFi lending losing 82% of its open borrows, according to the report.

5b9b96cd914f8dfd39244e55f5f2ff33,Cointelegraph,Analysts brace for Bitcoin slide on gloomy US manufacturing data,https://cointelegraph.com/news/analysts-brace-bitcoin-slide-us-manufacturing-data," The Federal Reserve's monthly manufacturing survey showed the sharpest decline in activity since 2020. 
Bitcoin’s spot price could take a hit after the US Federal Reserve reported some of the worst manufacturing data in recent history, according to several cryptocurrency analysts.
On April 17, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Manufacturing Index — a monthly survey of 250 US-based manufacturers — reported the sharpest declines in overall business activity since 2020. 
The data puts Bitcoin (BTC) “under short term pressure,” researchers at Bitunix, a crypto exchange, said in a post on the X platform. They added that Bitcoin could still see a “strong comeback” if its price holds above $83,000 per coin.  
As of April 18, Bitcoin has been trading at approximately $84,000 per coin, according to data from Google Finance. The Federal Reserve’s bearish report comes as factories brace for the impact of US President Donald Trump’s plans to impose sweeping tariffs on US imports, potentially raising production costs for manufacturers. 
“[I]ndicators for general activity, new orders, and shipments all fell and turned negative… suggest[ing] subdued expectations for growth over the next six months,” the report said.

Analysts said the combination of rising prices and slowing production could deal a blow to financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Rising prices limit central banks’ ability to support markets in a downturn. 
“Economic activity is falling off a cliff and any activity that remains, the prices are going up,” Felix Jauvin, a Blockworks macroeconomic analyst, said in a post on the X platform. 
It's an “[a]bsolute worst scenario for policy makers here especially with no meaningful idea of how permanent tariffs will be,” he added.
However, Bitcoin has been more resilient to recent macroeconomic shocks than stocks or other cryptocurrencies, Binance said in an April research report. 
Since Trump announced his tariff plans on April 2, Bitcoin has traded roughly flat after initially declining but more than 10%, Google Finance data shows. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 — an index of US stocks — is still down by around 7%. 
“Even in the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” Binance said. 
Trump initially sought to impose double-digit levies on virtually all foreign goods but later paused planned tariffs on certain countries. 
He still wants to place high taxes on many Chinese imports, causing concerns among crypto executives who fear a trade war could harm blockchain networks.

82eb00d24ed67a759ae76e50601ece5f,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin whales absorb 300% of newly mined BTC supply — Is $100K next?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whales-absorb-300-newly-mined-btc-supply," A BTC price technical breakout is underway that could send Bitcoin toward $100,000 by May. 
Bitcoin’s (BTC) richest traders and investors are increasingly bullish on BTC despite facing downside risks from unfavorable macroeconomic factors, the latest onchain data suggests. 
Bitcoin whales and sharks are now absorbing BTC at record rates—over 300% of yearly issuance—while exchanges are losing coins at a historic pace, according to Glassnode.
Notably, Bitcoin’s yearly absorption rate by exchanges has plunged below -200% as outflows continue. This signals a growing preference for self-custody or long-term investment.
Meanwhile, larger holders (100–1,000+ BTC) are scooping up more than three times the new issuance, marking the fastest rate of accumulation among sharks and whales in Bitcoin’s history. 
This marks a structural shift as traditional finance increasingly adopts BTC, particularly with the approval spot Bitcoin ETFs last year. The result is less BTC supply on crypto exchanges and long-term bullish conviction among big holders.
Bitcoin whales holding over 10,000 BTC remain in strong accumulation territory, with their Trend Accumulation Score at around 0.7 as of April 18, according to Glassnode.
This metric quantifies cohort behavior from distribution (0) to accumulation (1). The score implies confidence among the largest holders of Bitcoin.
In contrast, the sell-off in smaller cohorts that have been distributing earlier in the year appears to be slowing down. That includes the 10–100 BTC and the 1-100 BTC groups, whose scores have climbed back to a neutral zone at around 0.5.
Even the smallest cohort (
Onchain analyst Mignolet adds that the whale behavior is similar to what preceded Bitcoin’s 2020 bull run.
Bitcoin has broken out of a multimonth falling wedge pattern, signaling a potential bullish reversal that could drive its price toward the $100,000 mark by May.
A falling wedge forms when price action contracts between two downward-sloping trendlines and resolves with an upside breakout. Traders typically measure the wedge’s upside target by measuring its maximum height and adding the outcome to the breakout point. 
Applying this rule of technical analysis brings Bitcoin’s target to over $101,570.

Conversely, BTC’s price is testing its 50-day (the red wave) and 200-day (the blue wave) exponential moving averages (EMAs) around $85,300 as resistance. A bearish rejection from these EMAs risks pushing BTC’s price toward the wedge’s upper trendline near $80,000. 
“The 200-day moving average remains overhead as resistance, and the horizontal level at $88,804 is still the key barrier to flip market structure and print a higher high,” wrote market analyst Scott Melker, adding:

e615f12771e448675f88f8f073162a6c,Cointelegraph,Standardization is essential to enable crypto adoption,https://cointelegraph.com/news/standardization-is-essential-to-enable-adoption," A new set of standardizations for digital assets will strengthen stability and accelerate progress in DeFi technology by answering endless security questions. 
Opinion by: Axel Schorn and Dr. Duc Au
Traditional stocks, bonds and commodities markets have long benefited from well-established standards governing the flow of information and data. These standards underpin the seamless functioning of trading, settlement and regulatory compliance, ensuring all participants can rely on the same consistent frameworks.
As the financial industry moves into decentralized finance (DeFi) with the introduction of digital assets, like crypto assets and tokenized securities, the lack of such standards presents a growing challenge. 
While digital assets promise transformative potential, their fragmented information landscape risks undermining their adoption and integration into the broader financial ecosystem.
Independent platforms like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko provide information on various tokens, but this data varies significantly regarding market capitalization, total supply and other relevant reference data. Several global initiatives by private foundations and associations are working toward standardization. 
Traditional frameworks as a guideline 
Just as standardized financial data has been instrumental in building trust and facilitating growth, digital assets need their global standards. According to studies, standards generate overall economic benefits estimated at 17 billion euros annually in Germany alone.
For traditional assets, a clear hierarchy of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) exists to unambiguously categorize and identify each asset. The International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) is the global standard for uniquely identifying all types of financial instruments, including equities, debt, derivatives and indexes. The Certification of Financial Instruments (CFI) is the internationally recognized system for classifying financial instruments. It is defined when a financial or reference instrument is issued and remains unchanged. The Financial Instrument Short Name (FISN) outlines a standardized approach to short names and descriptions for financial instruments. Unlike ISIN and CFI, the FISN is not intended to be machine-readable but to provide a short format for key information about security for human use. 
National Numbering Agencies (NNA), responsible for collecting registration data such as issuer information, instrument types, terms and trading conditions, assign ISIN, CFI and FISN. The Association of National Numbering Agencies maintains the identifiers and data in a global database. For countries that do not have an NNA, four global Substitute Numbering Agencies assign identification to those countries.
Recent: DePIN needs a more cohesive narrative for mass adoption
ISINs are allocated to financial instruments regardless of the technology used for creating the respective instruments, both in paper form and electronic form, thereby including tokenized instruments such as crypto securities according to the German Electronic Securities Act. For tokens with an apparent geographical reference, such as the issuer of a security token residing in Germany, the responsible NNA will allocate the ISIN. Regarding tokens for referential instruments without an apparent geographical reference — e.g., Bitcoin (BTC), where the issuer’s country cannot be identified — an ISIN with the prefix “XT” is allocated from Etrading Software.
This helps to identify the instrument on the token level. More exemplary data fields on the token level are the type of token, hash function and generation mechanism. Focused on the instrument level, additional data elements like the token’s blockchain are needed.
For this purpose, the Digital Token Identifier Foundation, which is responsible for allocating this new identifier, provides the so-called Digital Token Identifier — e.g. DTI, ISO 24165. 
Key working theses regarding the standardization of digital assets 
Crypto identifiers could become mandatory. Similar to traditional assets using systems like ISINs, digital assets will adopt unique identifiers for cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities. These identifiers will facilitate tracking, trading and reporting across exchanges and custody providers, enabling seamless integration with legacy financial systems.
Data standards will enhance transparency and compliance: With increasing regulatory scrutiny, standardized data formats will emerge for compliance and risk management. 
Global coordination will drive interoperability: The standardization of digital assets will rely on global collaboration among regulatory bodies and financial institutions. International organizations will play pivotal roles in creating frameworks that ensure interoperability across jurisdictions and reduce market fragmentation and, thus, inconsistencies in information handling. 
Initial steps have been taken toward unambiguously identifying digital assets with generally accepted ISO identifiers. Combined with a European Union-wide regulation such as the regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), the industry lays the foundation for more significant adoption. 
It remains to be seen how investors and the digital assets player will further progress toward more standardization and what roadblocks may arise to be solved.

08ca1714a1c05379d47aa281fbab43e3,Cointelegraph,Quantum computers likely to reveal if Satoshi is alive — Adam Back,https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computers-likely-to-reveal-if-satoshi-is-alive-adam-back," Adam Back suggested that the emergence of quantum computing could force Satoshi Nakamoto to move their Bitcoin to protect it, revealing whether they are alive. 
Early cypherpunk Adam Back, cited by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper, suggested that quantum computing pressure may reveal whether the blockchain’s pseudonymous creator is alive.
During an interview after a Q&A session at the “Satoshi Spritz” event in Turin on April 18, Back suggested that quantum computing may force Nakamoto to move their Bitcoin (BTC). That’s because, according to Back, Bitcoin holders will be forced to move their assets to newer, quantum-resistant signature-based addresses.
Back said that current quantum computers do not pose a credible threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography but will likely threaten it in the future. Back estimated that quantum computers may evolve to that extent in “maybe 20 years.”

When the threat becomes real, Back said the Bitcoin community will have to choose between deprecating old, vulnerable addresses or letting those funds be stolen:
Back expects the community to go with the former option, forcing Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator to move their funds if they wish to avoid losing them.
Still, Back said that whether such a situation will reveal if Satoshi Nakamoto is alive also depends on Bitcoin’s future privacy features.
“It depends a bit on the technology, there are some research ideas that could add privacy to Bitcoin,” Back said. “So, possibly there might be a way to fix quantum issues while keeping privacy.“

Still, not everyone is convinced that — privacy enhancements or not — such a scenario would reveal whether Nakamoto was alive. An anonymous early Bitcoin miner and member of the Bitcoin community told Cointelegraph that he does not expect Nakamoto’s coins to be moved:
He added that, since this is a controversial choice, it makes sense to let the community decide. He said that he’d be surprised if Nakamoto came out of the woodwork to move the assets.
Back explained that most quantum-resistant signature implementations are either unproven in terms of security or very expensive from a data perspective. He cited Lamport signatures as an old and proven design, but pointed out that they weigh tens of kilobytes.
Consequently, he suggested that Bitcoin should be prepared to switch to quantum-resistant signatures but only do so when necessary. He suggested a Bitcoin taproot-based implementation allowing addresses to switch to quantum-resistant signatures when needed.

cfbdf0422d9b38eeb343b66a5ef0616e,Cointelegraph,Buying Bitcoin vs gold: Which is easier for investors to purchase?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/buying-bitcoin-vs-gold-which-asset-is-easier-to-acquire," Buying Bitcoin is easier than purchasing gold for crypto investors and users, but it still remains a complicated process in the TradFi world. 
As gold prices break new highs, many Bitcoiners are seeking ways to obtain exposure to the precious metal, but have been met with hurdles along the way.
Although physical gold is accessible in the form of jewelry, gold bars and coins, many industry executives are concerned about aspects like its quality, liquidity when selling, and buying at a premium above spot prices.
Still, gold advocates are confident that the precious metal is much easier to buy than Bitcoin (BTC), given the complexities of storing private keys and a steep learning curve for new crypto investors.
Both Bitcoin and gold are available in the form of tokenized assets, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other equity instruments, but the question of owning these assets in their original form reveals some differences.
“Buying Bitcoin is significantly easier and faster than buying physical gold,” Ross Shemeliak, co-founder of the tokenization platform Stobox, told Cointelegraph.
He referred to Bitcoin’s instant and 24/7 availability and no need for vaults, while gold is associated with additional costs like transportation, storage, verification and resale.
Adam Lowe, chief of product at the self-custodial wallet Arculus, agreed that buying physical gold is subject to many challenges and additional costs.
“The first is maintaining quality, assuring the purity is accurate,” Lowe said, adding that investors have to rely on the reputation of dealers and the supply chain when buying physical gold.

“Selling liquidity is also an issue as you have to find a buyer and will most likely pay a discount relative to the market price per ounce,” he continued, adding that self-custodied Bitcoin has none of these issues.
As well as limited liquidity, retail investors in physical gold face widened spreads, Shemeliak said, as they often have to buy at a premium above the market price of gold.
Unlike crypto investors, traditional finance (TradFi) investors and analysts are not so excited about self-custody opportunities offered by Bitcoin.
“Bitcoin could be very easy to buy if you have everything set up already, but if you don’t, it’s very difficult,” Rafi Farber, publisher of the gold-focused marketplace service End Game Investor, told Cointelegraph.
Farber, who has emerged as one of the biggest Bitcoin critics, referred to investor challenges for Bitcoin self-custody, which requires holders to safely store their private key or risk losing access to the coins.
While dealing with a self-custodial wallet, users have to “remember a string of random words or copy it down and put it in a safe, then copy and paste a gibberish code,” Farber said. “And if you lose any of the codes or the power goes out for whatever reason you’re screwed.”
Farber’s concerns over the challenges of self-custody are not without merit. Trezor, one of the most prominent self-custody wallet providers, admits that usability remains one of the key issues faced by self-custodial wallets.
While some have tried to offer simplified self-custody options, others insist that holding a private key is the only way to actually own a cryptocurrency, which requires onboarding and a learning curve — but doesn’t come without its own costs.
On the other hand, physical gold is “very easy to buy,” Farber said, suggesting options like coins or jewelry shops.
“Yes, buying a gold coin at a jewelry or coin shop is easy — but that doesn’t mean you’ve made a sound investment,” Stobox’s Shemeliak countered:
“In contrast, digital assets like Bitcoin or tokenized gold offer transparency, liquidity and verifiability,” he added.
Shemeliak doesn’t see Bitcoin and gold as direct competitors.
“Gold will always have historical value, but Bitcoin is building financial infrastructure for the next 100 years,” he said.
At the time of publication, the price of spot gold stood at $3,327, up nearly 27% year-to-date (YTD) as it continues breaking new highs, according to TradingView.
The picture is less appealing for Bitcoin, which reached new highs around $110,000 in December 2024. Bitcoin is down 10% YTD, trading at $84,525 at publication, according to CoinGecko.

62429545e7a7a8f45c61773251c4023c,Cointelegraph,Astar reduces base staking rewards to curb inflation pressure,https://cointelegraph.com/news/astar-network-staking-reward-10-percent-inflation," Astar Network’s efforts to curb inflation come days after its native token’s price reached a new all-time low. 
Blockchain firm Astar Network implemented changes to its tokenomics to reduce inflationary pressures in its ecosystem. 
On April 18, Astar Network announced that it reduced the blockchain’s base staking rewards to 10% from 25% to curb token inflation. 
The company said the change promotes a more stable annual percentage rate (APR) for users as staking inches closer to a more ideal ratio. The firm said this ensures that rewards “remain meaningful” without causing excessive inflation. 
“This change lowers automatic token issuance, reducing overall inflationary pressure while maintaining strong incentives for users to stake their ASTR,” Astar Network wrote. 
Unlike Bitcoin, which has a fixed total supply, the ASTR token operates under a dynamic inflation model without a cap on its maximum token supply. As the blockchain operates, it emits more tokens, increasing the supply. 
Having no fixed supply can often create downward pressure on the token’s value over time. This is especially true if the demand for the token does not keep up. To address this, Astar is introducing several new inflation-control mechanisms.
Apart from lowering staking rewards, Astar also started routing token emissions into a parameter that governs total value locked (TVL)-based rewards like decentralized application staking. This means that DApp staking APRs will become “more predictable” over time, offering stability to stakers. 
Astar also introduced a new minimum token emission threshold of 2.5% to ensure it doesn’t exceed a sustainable baseline. With continued transaction fee burning, Astar said it would also contribute to reward predictability. 
According to Astar, the changes have already lowered its annual inflation rate from 4.86% to 4.32%. It also lowered its total ASTR token emitted per block from 153.95 to 136.67 tokens. This reduces the token’s estimated annual emissions by 11%, going from 405 million to 360 million.

Astar Network’s efforts to curb token inflation come as its native token recently hit an all-time low. CoinGecko data shows that on April 7, the ASTR token declined to a new low of $0.02. The price is 93.8% lower than its peak three years ago, when it reached $0.42 on Jan. 17, 2022. 
In December 2024, the token rallied along with the rest of the market, hitting a high of $0.09. Since then, the crypto asset had continuously dropped in value before hitting the new all-time low.
