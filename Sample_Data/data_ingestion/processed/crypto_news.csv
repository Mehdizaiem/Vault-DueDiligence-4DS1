12dffdc428639b44180193803018498a,Cointelegraph,How crypto payments can become the new ‘tap-and-go’ — Pulsar co-founder,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-crypto-payments-can-become-the-new-tap-and-go-pulsar-co-founder," This episode of the Clear Crypto Podcast breaks down how social payments and crypto giveaways on X can make blockchain-based transactions fast, fun and finally mainstream. 
What if paying with crypto was as easy and as fun as sending a meme on X?
In the latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, StarkWare’s Nathan Jeffay and Cointelegraph’s Gareth Jenkinson sit down with Stefana Banciu, growth lead at Pulsar Money, to explore how blockchain is bringing payments into the digital age, with speed, transparency and a dash of playfulness.
Banciu lays out how Pulsar is pushing the frontier of Web3 payments with features like social transfers that allow users to send crypto directly through X, simply by tagging a handle. 
The episode cuts through the crypto jargon to tackle a question with mainstream resonance: Why aren’t we using crypto for everyday transactions yet?
“I wish I could say yes, but that wouldn’t be a true reflection of the state of affairs,” Jenkinson admits when asked if crypto is widely used for payments. He points to Mastercard-linked crypto cards as a stopgap, but says the real revolution hasn’t yet reached the coffee shop counter.

For Banciu, the path forward lies in bridging fun and fundamentals. While crypto’s founding ideals include borderless, permissionless transfers and low fees, she says onboarding the next wave of users will require experiences that are intuitive, social and entertaining.
Their platform includes a “social payments module” that lets users send crypto directly through X by tagging a handle, a small but powerful step toward making transactions feel more like communication than banking.
“You can actually send funds directly on Twitter,” Banciu says.
But convenience alone isn’t enough. Banciu says making crypto fun is key to onboarding the next wave of users. 
“We all know within the crypto space, the whole community that is here for perhaps something else than payments, which is quite boring, right?” she adds. “So we said, OK, why not think of a way to onboard users, make them do payments in a fun way?”
For Jenkinson, making crypto usable as a true “medium of exchange” is essential to its legitimacy.

5548915a06eb634979bce4f89f1acb89,Cointelegraph,New Hampshire Bitcoin reserve bill heads to full Senate vote,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-hampshire-bitcoin-reserve-bill-clears-senate-committee," New Hampshire’s House Bill 302 would allow the state treasurer to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion. 
A bill that would allow New Hampshire to invest a portion of its state funds in digital assets and precious metals has advanced to a full Senate vote after passing a second committee.
On April 23, House Bill 302 (HB 302) was reviewed in the second Senate committee and passed in a 4-1 vote.
The legislation, introduced in January, cleared the New Hampshire House earlier this month in a 192–179 vote. It now faces a vote by the full Senate and, if approved, will require the governor’s signature to become law.
Once enacted, it would allow the New Hampshire treasury to use 10% of the state’s general funds to invest in crypto with a market cap of over $500 billion — a threshold currently met only by Bitcoin (BTC).
During a debate before the full House vote, Democratic Representative Terry Spahr argued that the bill is unnecessary. 
The lawmaker said it could undermine the future security of the state’s digital asset stockpile. Spahr argued that the state treasurer already has the authority to manage investments without the bill.
Others said that it could earn the state good returns for its investment. Republican Representative Jordan Ulery said the investments could net the state a “large amount of money.”

Bitcoin Laws, which tracks the progress of digital asset legislation, shows that New Hampshire also has two more blockchain-related bills going through its legislature. 
HB 639 addresses blockchain dispute resolution and regulatory frameworks, while HB 310 focuses on real-world asset tokenization and stablecoin usage.
New Hampshire’s progress comes as Arizona pursues a more aggressive approach by exploring the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, aiming to become the first US state to implement the policy.

87a176f28d8ea1f22a53b07f7d0d2420,Cointelegraph,"Asian firms ramp up Bitcoin buys: Metaplanet, HK Asia lead charge",https://cointelegraph.com/news/asian-firms-bitcoin-accumulation-metaplanet-hk-asia-strategy," Metaplanet has reached 50% of its goal to accumulate 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 following its latest purchase. 
Asian investment firms are stepping up their Bitcoin accumulation strategies, with Japan’s Metaplanet and Hong Kong’s HK Asia Holdings leading the way.
Tokyo-based Metaplanet disclosed on April 24 that it acquired an additional 145 Bitcoin (BTC) for 1.9 billion Japanese yen (around $13.4 million), boosting its total holdings to 5,000 BTC.
Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich confirmed the company had reached 50% of its initial goal of amassing 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025.
The firm has been aggressive in its Bitcoin treasury operations, using bond issuances and Bitcoin income strategies such as selling cash-secured BTC put options to finance its acquisitions.
Since initiating its Bitcoin strategy, Metaplanet’s stock has surged over 3,000%. The company aims to hold 21,000 BTC by the close of 2026.

HK Asia Holdings has also announced plans to raise about $65 million Hong Kong dollars ($8.35 million) by issuing new shares and convertible notes to potentially buy more BTC.
According to an April 23 filing, the company entered into share subscription and convertible note (CN) subscription agreements after trading hours.
The deal includes issuing 3,272,000 new shares at a subscription price of HK$4.01 per share, alongside convertible notes valued at HK$52.38 million in aggregate principal amount. The newly issued shares will represent about 0.82% of HK Asia Holdings’ total shares in circulation.
While the filing does not mention that HK Asia Holdings intends to use the funds to buy Bitcoin, many in the crypto community speculated that the capital raise is expected to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions.
The speculation follows HK Asia’s February decision to step into Bitcoin markets. After buying its first BTC on Feb. 16, the firm doubled its share price within a day.
By Feb. 20, HK Asia expanded its holdings by purchasing an additional 7.88 BTC, bringing its total to nearly 9 BTC at an average price of $97,021 per coin.
Shares in HK Asia were up by around 5.4% on April 24 at the Hong Kong stock market closing, according to Google Finance.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the world’s largest publicly listed corporate Bitcoin holder, has championed the Bitcoin accumulation strategy by consistently issuing convertible notes and at-the-market (ATM) equity offerings to fund aggressive Bitcoin purchases.
In February, Strategy announced plans to raise another $2 billion through 0% senior convertible notes to purchase more Bitcoin.
As of April 20, Strategy held 538,200 BTC on its balance sheet. The figure includes the company’s most recent acquisition of 6,556 BTC for about $555.8 million.

aa0dd8d87acf52650886bfff44f66cae,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin's next big resistance is $95K— What will trigger the breakout?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-next-big-resistance-is-95k-what-will-trigger-breakout," Decreasing Bitcoin exchange inflows, resurgent ETF demand and other bullish factors could push BTC price above the next big hurdle at $95,000. 
Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows are at their highest since January 2025.
Inflows to exchanges down to levels last seen in December 2016.
Bitcoin’s negative funding rates could set up a short squeeze.
BTC price is above major moving averages, which can now provide support.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose to a new range high at $94,700 on April 23, its highest value since March 2.
Several analysts say the next psychological resistance remains at $95,000, and the price might drop to test support levels below.
“The $94K–$95K zone is clearly the resistance to beat,” said Swissblock in an April 24 post on X. 
The onchain data provider asserted that the next logical move for Bitcoin would be a pullback toward the $90,000 zone to gain momentum for a move higher.
Popular Bitcoin analyst AlphaBTC opined that the asset will likely consolidate in the $93,000-$95,000 range “before pushing higher to take liquidity above 100K.”
Several bullish signs suggest that BTC is well-positioned to break above $95,000 in the following days or weeks.
One factor supporting the Bitcoin bull argument is resurgent institutional demand, reflected by significant inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
On April 22 and April 23, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net flow totaling $936 million and $917 million, respectively, as per data from SoSoValue.
As Cointelegraph reported, these inflows have been the highest since January 2025 and more than 500 times the 2025 daily average.
This trend reflects growing confidence among traditional finance players, as observed by market analysts like Jamie Coutts, who noted global liquidity hitting new all-time highs, historically fueling asset price rallies. 
Institutional buying creates sustained upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price by absorbing the available supply.
The trend of decreasing Bitcoin exchange inflows continues, suggesting a potential reduction in sell pressure. 
The total amount of coins transferred to the exchanges has dropped from a year-to-date high of 97,940 BTC per day on Feb. 25 to 45,000 BTC on April 23, as per data from CryptoQuant. 
This is reinforced by a reduction in the number of addresses depositing Bitcoin to exchanges, which has been “steadily declining since 2022,” according to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. 
He highlights that this metric’s 30-day moving average has dropped to 52,000 BTC, a level last seen in December 2016. 
“This trend is bullish in itself,” as it represents a fourfold reduction in coin sales over the last three years, the analyst said, adding:
Bitcoin price has rebounded to levels last seen in early March, but futures trades are not entirely on board yet. 
Bitcoin’s perpetual futures funding rates remained negative between April 22 and April 23, despite the price rising by 11% over the same period, data from Glassnode shows.
Negative funding rates imply that shorts are paying longs, reflecting a bearish sentiment that can fuel a short squeeze as prices rise.

In an April 22 post on X, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost highlighted a similar divergence in Bitcoin’s price and Binance funding rates. 
“Whereas BTC continues to climb, funding rates on Binance have turned negative, currently sitting at around -0.006 at the time of writing,” Darkfost explained.
He added that this is a rare occurrence, which has historically been followed by significant rallies, like Bitcoin’s surge from $28,000 to $73,000 in October 2023, and from $57,000 to $108,000 in September 2024.
If history repeats itself, Bitcoin may rally from the current levels, breaking above the resistance at $95,000 toward $100,000.
On April 22, Bitcoin price rose above a key level: the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) currently at $88,690, fueling a marketwide recovery.
The last time the BTC price broke above the 200-day SMA, it experienced a parabolic move, rallying 80% from $66,000 on Oct. 14, 2024, to its previous all-time high of $108,000 on Dec. 17. 
This level should provide significant support as Bitcoin trades above this key trendline. But if it doesn’t hold, the following levels to watch will likely be $84,379, the 50-day SMA, and the $80,000 psychological level.
For the bulls, the resistance levels at $95,000 and $100,000 are the primary ones to watch. Rising above that would pave the way for a run toward the Jan. 20 all-time high above $109,000.

1d44d90a88aa5f5809ac46362c929ea2,Cointelegraph,"Trump fought the bond market, the bond market won: Saifedean Ammous",https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-fought-bond-market-bond-market-won," The volatility of US bonds during tariff escalations may reignite Bitcoin’s unique economic properties as a safe-haven and potential reserve asset, Ammous said. 
Analysts are criticizing the financial implications of US President Donald Trump’s import tariffs, a development that some say highlights Bitcoin’s unique economic properties during times of global uncertainty.
Trump’s 90-day pause on higher reciprocal tariffs, reverting them to a 10% baseline for most countries except China, has exposed vulnerabilities in the US bond market, according to critics.
Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, said Trump’s decision to reverse the higher tariffs was likely a reaction to rising bond yields, suggesting the administration’s hand was forced.
“Trump fought the bond market and the bond market won,” Ammous said in an April 23 X post. “The gambit seemed to work for the first day, and the huge crash in the stock market was presented as a small price to pay for fiscal sustainability.
“But then the bonds began to crash, and it became clear how disastrous the tariffs were, and how wrong it was to expect that deliberately crashing the stock market would boost the bond market,” he added.
Related: Trump’s tariff escalation exposes ‘deeper fractures’ in global financial system
Following Trump’s tariff announcement, CNBC data shows that the 10-year Treasury yield surged from under 4% to 4.5% amid a sell-off driven by inflation and recession concerns.  
“The rise in yields was the exact opposite of what the administration wanted, and reversing course on the tariffs half a day after they go into effect was absolutely devastating for Trump’s negotiating position,” Ammous said.
Some analysts, including Global Macro Investor founder Raoul Pal, have suggested the tariff maneuvering may only be “posturing” for the US to reach a trade agreement with China.
“All of the talk about China buckling under the threat of Trump now sounds hilarious in retrospect, when Trump could not keep his tariffs in place for two days,” Ammous said, adding that China “showed absolutely no inclination” to reach out and strike a deal.
Delays in reaching a trade agreement may limit the recovery of both equity and cryptocurrency markets, which hinge on the outcomes of the trade negotiations, according to Nansen analysts.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) is acting “less like a tech stock and more like a hedge against economic uncertainty,” after Trump signaled a “substantial reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods,” Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev told Cointelegraph.

The situation has revived long-standing proposals to back the US dollar with Bitcoin. 
Ammous said the US should keep buying BTC until the government holds enough to fully back the dollar supply, ultimately switching to a Bitcoin standard:
Historically, the dollar was backed by gold and redeemable for a fixed amount of the precious metal until 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt suspended gold convertibility in response to the Great Depression.
In 1971, President Richard Nixon halted the dollar’s convertibility into gold, aiming to protect the US gold reserves and stabilize the economy, marking the beginning of the fiat currency system that remains in place today.
Bitcoin’s fixed supply, which is hard-coded in its tokenomics, makes it a popular digital competitor to gold. 
Joe Burnett, director of market research at Unchained, predicted that Bitcoin may rival or surpass gold’s market capitalization in the next decade, projecting that the Bitcoin price will surpass $1.8 million by 2035.

Key points:
Bitcoin exchange 100-day average netflows are at their most negative since the start of the current bull market in 2023.
Exchange balances continue to plumb new multiyear lows.
Whales are particularly active buyers this month, while retail shows classic “panic selling.”
Bitcoin (BTC) exchanges are evoking the end of the 2022 crypto bear market as user inflows dry up this year.
Data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant reveals exchanges’ average net flows hitting two-year records.
Bitcoin may be trading significantly higher than at the start of 2023, but demand for BTC among exchange users is reminiscent of the start of a bull market.
CryptoQuant reveals that the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) of exchange net flows recently hit its most negative figure in two years.
“This essentially indicates the highest Bitcoin outflow from exchanges since that date,” contributor CryptoOnChain commented in one of its “Quicktake” blog posts on April 23. 
A negative net flow tally indicates outflows from exchange surpassing inflows, reflecting more user demand than a desire to send BTC to exchange accounts for a potential sale.
As Cointelegraph reported, overall exchange BTC balances are at their lowest in many years.
CryptoQuant shows reserves hitting 2.535 million BTC in early April, down over 7% from 2.740 million BTC at the start of the year.
Elsewhere, larger Bitcoin entities have added to their portion of the supply throughout April, even as smaller retail investors sell.

“Whales (1k-10k balance) have been accumulating hard since March, even as price slid,” crypto analyst Miles Deutscher noted on X this week alongside CryptoQuant data. 
Research firm Santiment drew similar conclusions about entities holding at least 10 BTC, which it referred to as “key stakeholders.”
“Bitcoin’s key stakeholders comprised of wallets holding between 10 & 10K BTC currently hold 67.77% of the entire supply of crypto’s top market cap asset,” an X post reported.

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has been named the best new ETF product by etf.com, as it recorded its highest inflows since Jan. 21. 
On April 23, BlackRock’s iShare Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) was awarded the “Best New ETF” at the annual etf.com ETF awards. In an X post shortly after, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said it “feels right to me.”
“I’m pretty sure this is how I voted. Both of them did things no one has seen [before],” Balchunas said, also referencing the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) winning the “ETF of the Year” award. Over the past 5 years, VOO is up 89%, according to Google Finance data.
IBIT was also the recipient of the Crypto ETP of the year. 
IBIT’s two awards came on the same day IBIT recorded $643.2 million in inflows, according to Farside data. It was the highest inflow day since Jan. 21, when it saw $661.9 million, just a day after US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, when Bitcoin’s spot price hit an all-time high of $109,000.
Bitcoin commentator Vivek said this “is massive,” while Apollo Sats co-founder Thomas Fahrer said, “Huge inflow.”
The IBIT fund, which launched in January 2024 alongside 10 other US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, has net assets of approximately $53.77 billion, according to BlackRock data. Over the past 30 days, it has traded, on average, 45.02 million shares per day. 
At the time of publication, a single IBIT share is trading at $53.20, as per Google Finance data.
Meanwhile, VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) received the award for “Best new ETF ticker.”

IBIT’s large inflow on April 23 made up most of the $917 million seen across all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs that day. It was the second day in a row with over $900 million in inflows amid most of the month posting outflow days due to macro uncertainty.
On April 23, Glassnode pointed out that the $912 million ETF inflows the day prior equaled more than 500 times the 2025 daily average.

d41ecfac92bee56918e9d4ba54a30d36,Cointelegraph,"Russia’s central bank, finance ministry to launch crypto exchange",https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-ministry-finance-central-bank-launch-crypto-exchange," Russia’s central bank announced a proposal in March to allow a limited number of Russian investors with a certain amount of assets to buy and sell cryptocurrencies under a three-year experimental regime. 
Russia’s finance ministry and central bank are reportedly planning to launch a crypto exchange for qualified investors under an experimental legal regime.
The platform will be aimed at “super-qualified investors,” Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said during a ministry meeting, according to April 23 reports from Russian media group RBC and Russian news agency Interfax.
“Together with the central bank, we will launch a crypto exchange for super-qualified investors. Crypto assets will be legalized, and crypto operations will be brought out of the shadows,” he said in a statement translated from Russian.
“Naturally, this will not happen domestically, but as part of the operations permitted under the experimental legal regime.”
The Russian central bank announced a proposal on March 12 to allow a limited number of Russian investors with a certain amount of assets to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) under a three-year experimental regime.
Under the proposal, the bank created a new investor category, super-qualified investors, defined by wealth and income thresholds of over 100 million rubles ($1.2 million) or a yearly income of at least 50 million rubles ($602,000).
The deputy director of the Finance Ministry’s financial policy department, Osman Kabaloev, said the criteria for a super-qualified investor are not yet final because they were floated in the early stages of discussions last year, according to RBC.
“Perhaps it will be in this format, or these indicators will be somehow adjusted in one direction or another - this is possible, I think there will be a wide range of discussions,” Kabaloev said in a statement translated from Russian.
Russia implemented a ban on using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for payments under its first crypto law, which came into force in January 2021.
However, the country has since been trying to make other crypto inroads. On April 16, Kabaloev said the Kremlin should be creating its own stablecoin after a recent freeze on wallets linked to the sanctioned Russian exchange Garantex by US authorities and stablecoin issuer Tether.

Bitcoin has shown resilience compared to the broader financial market amid macroeconomic uncertainty, but analysts caution it’s still too early to know whether the trend will last.
“We’re not quite there yet, but if Bitcoin holds strength through the upcoming CPI, as well as ongoing Powell-related and equity earnings volatility, the decoupling narrative could evolve from “temporary divergence” to “regime change,” Bitfinex analysts said in an April 23 markets note viewed by Cointelegraph.
The analysts said that while Bitcoin’s (BTC) relative strength against US equities “appears real,” it is yet to be confirmed as structural. The analysts warned that Bitcoin has previously seen short periods of outperformance, only to eventually fall back in line with the broader market.
Cointelegraph recently reported that Bitcoin is increasingly abandoning its stock correlation to copy gold’s upside. At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s price has posted gains of 7.68% over the past 30 days. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are down 6.79% and 8.14%, respectively, as per Google Finance data.
Over the same period, Nvidia (NVDA), which has outperformed Bitcoin over the past decade, fell 15.4%. The analysts attributed the decline to the “effective ban on advanced chip exports to China and tariff-driven volatility.” In May 2024, Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said there is a “near zero chance of Nvidia outperforming Bitcoin over the next 10 years.”
The Bitfinex analysts described the current crypto market as a “hybrid state,” with rising macroeconomic risk on one side and an uptick in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows on the other. 
April 22 alone saw $913 million in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, the largest since late January.
They added that this reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a strong store of value, with Bitcoin dominance rising to levels not seen since late 2021. 
At the time of publication, Bitcoin's dominance was 64.39%, according to TradingView data.

Crypto market participants will be closely watching April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI), published on May 13, after March data showed a cooling trend that some saw as a short-term bearish signal for Bitcoin.
March’s CPI came in at 2.4% year-over-year, down from 2.8% in February, the lowest level since February 2023, according to the US Bureau of Statistics.
Meanwhile, some crypto analysts caution that other indicators suggest Bitcoin’s rally may not last.
10x Research head of research Markus Thielen said, “Given that our stablecoin minting indicator has yet to return to high-activity levels, we remain cautious about the sustainability of the current Bitcoin rally.”

The Los Angeles Police Department has recovered $2.7 million worth of Bitcoin mining machines it alleges were stolen by a crime ring in a heist at the city’s airport.
The LAPD said on April 22 that detectives from its Cargo Theft Unit, along with the city’s Port Police, the railroad-based Union Pacific Police, and the city’s Airport Police, arrested Oscar David Borrero-Manchola and Yonaiker Rafael Martinez-Ramos over the thefts.
Authorities claimed the pair are “prominent members” of a South American crime ring tied to the theft and sale of stolen goods in and around Los Angeles.
The LAPD said searches of storage unit facilities in the San Fernando Valley, northeast of downtown Los Angeles, recovered $4 million worth of stolen goods, including the Bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs taken from Los Angeles International Airport “as the shipment was about to be loaded onto a plane headed to Hong Kong.”
Detectives also found and seized over $1.2 million in allegedly stolen tequila, clothing, shoes, speakers, coffee, body wash, and pet food.
Borrero-Manchola and Martinez-Ramos were booked at Van Nuys Jail in the city’s northwest. Borrero-Manchola was cited for receiving stolen property and was released, while Martinez-Ramos was arrested on a no-bail warrant.
The LAPD said that “the investigation remains ongoing, and additional arrests may follow.”
The LAPD didn’t share the number of machines it seized or what model the rigs are, but a typical, current-model Bitcoin mining machine sells for between $3,000 to over $5,000.

US law enforcement has recovered stolen crypto mining rigs in the past. In July, the LAPD said it arrested a man it alleged was in possession of stolen Bitcoin mining rigs worth $579,000, seizing them from a cargo van and storage unit.
One of the largest thefts of Bitcoin mining rigs happened in late 2017 and early 2018 in Iceland, where a group robbed data centers to make off with over 600 machines.
The rigs reportedly ended up in China, as just three months after they were stolen, Chinese authorities seized a similar number and model of mining rigs in Tianjin, a city southeast of the capital, Beijing.
