BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has been named the best new ETF product by etf.com, as it recorded its highest inflows since Jan. 21. 
On April 23, BlackRock’s iShare Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) was awarded the “Best New ETF” at the annual etf.com ETF awards. In an X post shortly after, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said it “feels right to me.”
“I’m pretty sure this is how I voted. Both of them did things no one has seen [before],” Balchunas said, also referencing the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) winning the “ETF of the Year” award. Over the past 5 years, VOO is up 89%, according to Google Finance data.
IBIT was also the recipient of the Crypto ETP of the year. 
IBIT’s two awards came on the same day IBIT recorded $643.2 million in inflows, according to Farside data. It was the highest inflow day since Jan. 21, when it saw $661.9 million, just a day after US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, when Bitcoin’s spot price hit an all-time high of $109,000.
Bitcoin commentator Vivek said this “is massive,” while Apollo Sats co-founder Thomas Fahrer said, “Huge inflow.”
The IBIT fund, which launched in January 2024 alongside 10 other US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, has net assets of approximately $53.77 billion, according to BlackRock data. Over the past 30 days, it has traded, on average, 45.02 million shares per day. 
At the time of publication, a single IBIT share is trading at $53.20, as per Google Finance data.
Meanwhile, VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) received the award for “Best new ETF ticker.”

IBIT’s large inflow on April 23 made up most of the $917 million seen across all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs that day. It was the second day in a row with over $900 million in inflows amid most of the month posting outflow days due to macro uncertainty.
On April 23, Glassnode pointed out that the $912 million ETF inflows the day prior equaled more than 500 times the 2025 daily average.

d41ecfac92bee56918e9d4ba54a30d36,Cointelegraph,"Russia’s central bank, finance ministry to launch crypto exchange",https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-ministry-finance-central-bank-launch-crypto-exchange," Russia’s central bank announced a proposal in March to allow a limited number of Russian investors with a certain amount of assets to buy and sell cryptocurrencies under a three-year experimental regime. 
Russia’s finance ministry and central bank are reportedly planning to launch a crypto exchange for qualified investors under an experimental legal regime.
The platform will be aimed at “super-qualified investors,” Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said during a ministry meeting, according to April 23 reports from Russian media group RBC and Russian news agency Interfax.
“Together with the central bank, we will launch a crypto exchange for super-qualified investors. Crypto assets will be legalized, and crypto operations will be brought out of the shadows,” he said in a statement translated from Russian.
“Naturally, this will not happen domestically, but as part of the operations permitted under the experimental legal regime.”
The Russian central bank announced a proposal on March 12 to allow a limited number of Russian investors with a certain amount of assets to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) under a three-year experimental regime.
Under the proposal, the bank created a new investor category, super-qualified investors, defined by wealth and income thresholds of over 100 million rubles ($1.2 million) or a yearly income of at least 50 million rubles ($602,000).
The deputy director of the Finance Ministry’s financial policy department, Osman Kabaloev, said the criteria for a super-qualified investor are not yet final because they were floated in the early stages of discussions last year, according to RBC.
“Perhaps it will be in this format, or these indicators will be somehow adjusted in one direction or another - this is possible, I think there will be a wide range of discussions,” Kabaloev said in a statement translated from Russian.
Russia implemented a ban on using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for payments under its first crypto law, which came into force in January 2021.
However, the country has since been trying to make other crypto inroads. On April 16, Kabaloev said the Kremlin should be creating its own stablecoin after a recent freeze on wallets linked to the sanctioned Russian exchange Garantex by US authorities and stablecoin issuer Tether.

Meanwhile, Evgeny Masharov, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, proposed on March 20 to create a Russian government crypto fund that would include assets confiscated from criminal proceedings.
At the same time, other officials were progressing with new legislation on recognizing crypto as property for the purposes of criminal procedure legislation.

e64e266917e85ebf0d15a5c8efd9d83d,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin is the ‘cleanest shirt in the dirty laundry’ — Bitfinex,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-strength-us-stocks-equities-uncertainty-bitfinex-crypto-analysts," Bitcoin is up 7.68% over the past 30 days, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are down 6.79% and 8.14% respectively. 
Bitcoin has shown resilience compared to the broader financial market amid macroeconomic uncertainty, but analysts caution it’s still too early to know whether the trend will last.
“We’re not quite there yet, but if Bitcoin holds strength through the upcoming CPI, as well as ongoing Powell-related and equity earnings volatility, the decoupling narrative could evolve from “temporary divergence” to “regime change,” Bitfinex analysts said in an April 23 markets note viewed by Cointelegraph.
The analysts said that while Bitcoin’s (BTC) relative strength against US equities “appears real,” it is yet to be confirmed as structural. The analysts warned that Bitcoin has previously seen short periods of outperformance, only to eventually fall back in line with the broader market.
Cointelegraph recently reported that Bitcoin is increasingly abandoning its stock correlation to copy gold’s upside. At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s price has posted gains of 7.68% over the past 30 days. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are down 6.79% and 8.14%, respectively, as per Google Finance data.
Over the same period, Nvidia (NVDA), which has outperformed Bitcoin over the past decade, fell 15.4%. The analysts attributed the decline to the “effective ban on advanced chip exports to China and tariff-driven volatility.” In May 2024, Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said there is a “near zero chance of Nvidia outperforming Bitcoin over the next 10 years.”
The Bitfinex analysts described the current crypto market as a “hybrid state,” with rising macroeconomic risk on one side and an uptick in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows on the other. 
April 22 alone saw $913 million in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, the largest since late January.
They added that this reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a strong store of value, with Bitcoin dominance rising to levels not seen since late 2021. 
At the time of publication, Bitcoin's dominance was 64.39%, according to TradingView data.

Crypto market participants will be closely watching April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI), published on May 13, after March data showed a cooling trend that some saw as a short-term bearish signal for Bitcoin.
March’s CPI came in at 2.4% year-over-year, down from 2.8% in February, the lowest level since February 2023, according to the US Bureau of Statistics.
Meanwhile, some crypto analysts caution that other indicators suggest Bitcoin’s rally may not last.
10x Research head of research Markus Thielen said, “Given that our stablecoin minting indicator has yet to return to high-activity levels, we remain cautious about the sustainability of the current Bitcoin rally.”

The Los Angeles Police Department has recovered $2.7 million worth of Bitcoin mining machines it alleges were stolen by a crime ring in a heist at the city’s airport.
The LAPD said on April 22 that detectives from its Cargo Theft Unit, along with the city’s Port Police, the railroad-based Union Pacific Police, and the city’s Airport Police, arrested Oscar David Borrero-Manchola and Yonaiker Rafael Martinez-Ramos over the thefts.
Authorities claimed the pair are “prominent members” of a South American crime ring tied to the theft and sale of stolen goods in and around Los Angeles.
The LAPD said searches of storage unit facilities in the San Fernando Valley, northeast of downtown Los Angeles, recovered $4 million worth of stolen goods, including the Bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs taken from Los Angeles International Airport “as the shipment was about to be loaded onto a plane headed to Hong Kong.”
Detectives also found and seized over $1.2 million in allegedly stolen tequila, clothing, shoes, speakers, coffee, body wash, and pet food.
Borrero-Manchola and Martinez-Ramos were booked at Van Nuys Jail in the city’s northwest. Borrero-Manchola was cited for receiving stolen property and was released, while Martinez-Ramos was arrested on a no-bail warrant.
The LAPD said that “the investigation remains ongoing, and additional arrests may follow.”
The LAPD didn’t share the number of machines it seized or what model the rigs are, but a typical, current-model Bitcoin mining machine sells for between $3,000 to over $5,000.

US law enforcement has recovered stolen crypto mining rigs in the past. In July, the LAPD said it arrested a man it alleged was in possession of stolen Bitcoin mining rigs worth $579,000, seizing them from a cargo van and storage unit.
One of the largest thefts of Bitcoin mining rigs happened in late 2017 and early 2018 in Iceland, where a group robbed data centers to make off with over 600 machines.
The rigs reportedly ended up in China, as just three months after they were stolen, Chinese authorities seized a similar number and model of mining rigs in Tianjin, a city southeast of the capital, Beijing.

96a904b8c8782e8fbd9c56c949ede07f,Cointelegraph,Strike’s Mallers to head firm seeking superior Bitcoin play to MSTR,https://cointelegraph.com/news/twenty-one-capital-bitcoin-firm-compete-michael-saylor-strategy," Twenty One Capital has grand plans to dethrone Michael Saylor’s Strategy as the leading Bitcoin treasury firm, receiving investment support from industry heavyweights. 
Twenty One Capital, a new Bitcoin treasury company led by Strike founder Jack Mallers with the support of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald, is looking to supplant Michael Saylor’s Strategy to become the “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.”
Twenty One revealed it plans to launch with 42,000 Bitcoin (BTC) (worth $3.9 billion) with roughly 23,950 BTC coming from Tether, 10,500 BTC from Softbank and 7,000 BTC from Bitfinex, which will be converted into equity at $10 per share, according to an April 23 statement.
The firm is seeking a public listing via a blank-check merger with Cantor Equity Partners and will trade under the ticker XXI on the Nasdaq once it finalizes an agreement with investors to raise $585 million through convertible bonds and equity financing.
“Our mission is simple: to become the most successful company in Bitcoin, the most valuable financial opportunity of our time. We’re not here to beat the market, we’re here to build a new one,” said Mallers, the founder and CEO of Bitcoin payments-focused firm Strike.
Twenty One specifically compared its business model to Strategy’s in an investor presentation to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, claiming it is potentially a “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.”
It claimed that Strategy’s ability to create shareholder value through future Bitcoin purchases will be limited because the firm — which holds 534,741 BTC — would need to make even larger investments to increase its Bitcoin Per Share, or BPS, thus diminishing the per-share dollar impact of future capital deployments.
Twenty One said it would be a more “pure play” for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure with Bitcoin-native operations and more “flexibility” for strategic capital raises. 
A launch of 42,000 Bitcoin would make Twenty One the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only Strategy and Bitcoin mining firm  MARA Holdings, which holds 47,600 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data.
Twenty One also intends to build out several Bitcoin-focused offerings, including Bitcoin debt and equity products, an advisory service, a lending platform and an educational platform.
“Twenty One’s mission will be to accelerate Bitcoin adoption and Bitcoin literacy at both institutional and retail levels,” the firm said.

The firm will also partner with industry players to host Bitcoin conferences.
The news sparked a massive 54.2% price rally in Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) shares to $16.50 on April 23 and has risen another 25.1% in after-hours, Google Finance data shows. CEP will convert to XXI once the $585 million agreement is completed.
The venture strengthens Tether’s ties with Cantor, which manages US Treasury reserves backing Tether’s USDT, which boasts a market cap of $145.3 billion. Cantor also owns a 5% stake in the stablecoin issuer.
Twenty One will be majority-owned by Tether and crypto exchange Bitfinex, while Japanese investment holding firm SoftBank will own a “significant” minority share.

Sovereign wealth funds and other institutions were accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) during April 2025, while retail traders were exiting the markets via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and spot markets, according to John D’Agostino, the head of strategy at Coinbase Institutional.
During a recent appearance on CNBC, the Coinbase executive likened Bitcoin to gold and said that many institutional buyers bought BTC as a hedge against currency inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Coinbase executive said:
""When you do the work, there's a very short list of assets that mirror the characteristics of gold. Bitcoin is on that shortlist,"" the executive added.
Governments and financial institutions are increasingly adopting Bitcoin to protect purchasing power and the value of their treasuries in the face of macroeconomic shocks and geopolitical tensions.

Sovereign countries like El Salvador and Bhutan have adopted national Bitcoin reserves and actively purchase Bitcoin for their reserves.
Municipalities and state governments have also adopted pro-Bitcoin policies and proposed legislation to accumulate Bitcoin to protect the purchasing power of treasuries from depreciating fiat currencies.
Michael Saylor and Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, popularized the corporate Bitcoin treasury concept now adopted by a growing list of companies, including MARA, MetaPlanet, and Semler Scientific.
The executive also transformed the business software and intelligence company into a Bitcoin holding firm, akin to a BTC hedge fund.
On April 20, Saylor announced that over 13,000 institutions have direct exposure to Strategy, while an estimated 55 million beneficiaries have indirect financial exposure to the company.
Bitcoin recently surpassed Google in market capitalization, making Bitcoin one of the top five assets in the world, ranking above Amazon and Silver and showcasing the supply-capped digital asset's meteoric growth since 2009.

cc3ac4ae692e405be0b542d4ef8db427,Cointelegraph,"Traders pour into leveraged ETFs, gold in bid to weather volatility — Bloomberg",https://cointelegraph.com/news/traders-into-leveraged-etfs-gold-volatility-bloomberg," US spot Bitcoin ETFs clocked nearly $1 billion in inflows on April 22 despite turbulent markets. 
Traders are embracing diametrically opposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) strategies in a bid to navigate one of the most unpredictable financial markets in recent history, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence. 
The year-to-date has seen record inflows to ETFs providing leveraged long exposure to volatile assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, as well as funds holding risk-off assets such as cash and gold, the data shows. 
“[T]here's basically record flows going into leveraged long ETFs but also cash and gold ETFs as people buy the dip and hedge the dip at the same time. May the best degen win!,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said in an April 23 post on the X platform.
Leveraged ETFs are funds that aim to multiply the daily performance of assets like stocks or crypto, often by two or three times.
In 2025, leveraged long ETFs attracted net inflows of roughly $6 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Meanwhile, inflows into cash and gold funds approached roughly $4 billion. 
The record fund flows come amid a spike in market turbulence after US President Donald Trump announced plans for sweeping tariffs on US imports on April 2.
Since then, the S&P 500, an index of large US stocks, has shed roughly 5% of its value, according to data from Google Finance. Bitcoin (BTC), meanwhile, has been comparatively resilient. 
On April 22, the cryptocurrency’s spot price reclaimed $90,000 per coin for the first time in six weeks, with Bitcoin ETFs clocking nearly $1 billion in net inflows. The cryptocurrency trades above $93,000 as of April 23, according to data from Google Finance. 
“Even in the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, said in an April research report.  
Bitcoin has often been referred to as “digital gold” but the cryptocurrency still has a weak correlation to the safe haven asset and trades more in line with equities, Binance said. Its correlation with gold has averaged around 0.12 over the past 90 days, versus 0.32 for equities.  
“The key question is whether BTC can return to its long-term pattern of low correlation with equities,” noted the report, adding that gold is still a preferred safe-haven asset for most investors.
Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchanges are profiting off of rising volatility by doubling down on financial derivatives, such as futures. 
In April, net open interest in Bitcoin futures increased by upward of 30%, to approximately $28 billion, according to data from Coinalyze.

Key Takeaways:
Bitcoin short-term holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $100,000.
Long-term holders added 363,000 BTC since February, with new buyers injecting capital in April.
Bitcoin sell pressure risk exists at $97,000, where 392,000 BTC could be sold. 
Bitcoin’s (BTC) surge above $91,700 on April 22 pushed its value above the short-term realized price or cost basis. This implies that a majority of short-term holders (STHs) are currently back in profit.
STHs returning to profit after unrealized losses signal a bullish outlook, paving the way for a potential $100,000 retest.
Historically, during the early phase of a rally, STHs in profit provided upward momentum by holding firm and drawing in new investors. Bitcoin’s supply mapping indicated “strong activity” in April from first-time buyers, indicating fresh capital injections in the market at higher prices. 
Long-term holders (those holding for more than 155 days) increased their allocation by 363,000 BTC since February, while Bitcoin whales and sharks have absorbed 300% of the yearly issuance. 
Despite this week’s price breakout, Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. noted that the last strong resistance remains at $96,100. In an X post, the analyst said, 
Related: Why is Bitcoin price up today?
According to Bitcoin’s cost basis distribution data, investors hold approximately 392,000 BTC at an average cost basis of $97,000, creating a potential resistance zone. This concentration suggests many investors may sell at break-even, potentially stalling Bitcoin’s upward momentum.
However, anonymous trader Ezy Bitcoin emphasized Bitcoin's price action in the Wyckoff reaccumulation phase is “playing out beautifully”. The chart indicated continued strength, with three price targets: $131,500 (target 1), $144,900 (target 2), and $166,700 (target 3). 
This Wyckoff pattern points to possible accumulation by large players, signaling an upward trend for Bitcoin, as the market absorbs supply and prepares for an uptrend.

United States Senator Cynthia Lummis suggests the crypto industry may be celebrating too soon over the US Federal Reserve softening its crypto guidance for banks.
“The Fed withdrawing crypto guidance is just noise, not real progress,” Lummis said in an April 25 X post. Lummis called the Fed’s April 24 announcement — withdrawing its 2022 supervisory letter that had discouraged banks from engaging with crypto and stablecoin activities — “just lip service.”
Lummis, a pro-crypto advocate known for introducing the Bitcoin (BTC) Strategic Reserve Bill in July 2024, pointed out several flaws in the Fed’s announcement, even as Strategy founder Michael Saylor and crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano suggested it was a step forward for banks and crypto.
She argued that the Fed continues to “illegally flout the law on master accounts” and still relies on reputational risk in its bank supervision practices. It comes as the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC) is working on a rule to stop examiners from considering reputational risk when reviewing a bank’s operations, according to a recent Bloomberg report.
Lummis also highlighted the Fed’s policy statement in Section 9(13), which hasn’t been withdrawn, stating that Bitcoin and digital assets are considered “unsafe and unsound.”
She also reiterated many of the same staff behind Operation Chokepoint 2.0 are still involved in crypto policy today.
“I will continue to hold the Fed accountable until the digital asset industry gets more than a life jacket, Chair Powell — they need a fair shake,” Lummis said.
Related: If Trump fired Powell, what would happen to crypto?
Custodia Bank founder and CEO Caitlin Long seemed to share a similar view to Lummis.
“THANK YOU for seeing this for what it is,” Long said.
However, many crypto executives praised the Fed’s announcement as a positive development for the industry. Saylor said in an April 25 X post that the Fed’s move means that “banks are now free to begin supporting Bitcoin.”
Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum, said the Fed’s decision “is a significant development, as it will simplify the path to institutional adoption.”

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the United States saw over $3 billion in inflows this week, marking the first full week of consecutive inflows in five weeks.
On April 25, the 11 spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs saw $380 million in inflows, bringing the total for the week to around $3.06 billion over five consecutive inflow days, according to Farside data. The last time spot Bitcoin ETFs had a full week of inflow days was the trading week ending March 21.
ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in an April 24 X post that “ETFs are on a Bitcoin bender.”
“What’s really notable here is just HOW FAST the flows can go from 1st gear to 5th gear,” Balchunas said, forecasting that some of those flows may be due to the “basis trade back in effect.”
Amid ongoing financial and macroeconomic uncertainty, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a volatile April, with nine out of the total 18 trading days so far being outflow days. 
However, a strong surge of inflows over the past week has turned the month positive, bringing total net inflows for April to approximately $2.26 billion.
On the same day, Strategy founder Michael Saylor reportedly said at the Bitwise Invest Bitcoin Corporations Investor Day that BlackRock’s iShare Bitcoin ETF “will be “the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.”

Just two days prior, on April 23, BlackRock’s iShare Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) was awarded the “Best New ETF” at the annual etf.com ETF awards. IBIT was also the recipient of Crypto ETP of the year.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s spot price continues to hover around the $95,000 price level, currently trading at $94,613 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. Institutions are continuing to raise their bullish price targets.
Billion-dollar asset manager ARK Invest recently raised its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, driven largely by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as “digital gold.”
ARK’s “bear” and “base” case scenarios for the price of Bitcoin were also bumped up to $500,000 and $1.2 million.

Strike CEO Jack Mallers said his new role as CEO of Bitcoin treasury firm Twenty One Capital won’t distract him from heading Strike, revealing the platform processed over $6 billion in volume in 2024.
“This is not a shift in my commitment; it’s an extension of it,” Mallers said in an April 25 letter to Strike investors.
“If Bitcoin wins, humanity wins. Every business decision I make starts with one question: Is this good for Bitcoin? Twenty One exists because I believe it is good for Bitcoin and, therefore, good for the world,” Mallers said.
Mallers explained that Strike, a Bitcoin payments platform, and Twenty One Capital have different goals. He said Strike focuses on making “Bitcoin accessible globally,” while Twenty One aims to increase “Bitcoin ownership per share (BPS) and pioneer Bitcoin-native financial tools.”
“These are separate companies, but they share the same ethos: Bitcoin wins, we win,” he said.
It comes after Twenty One Capital announced its launch on April 23, with the backing of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald. 
The firm is looking to challenge Michael Saylor’s Strategy to become the “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” It revealed its plans to launch with 42,000 Bitcoin (BTC).
Mallers shared key metrics for Strike publicly for the first time, revealing that in 2024, the firm posted over $6 billion in volume, recorded 600% year-on-year growth, maintained an 85% gross profit margin, and reported zero customer acquisition costs.
Mallers said that despite maintaining a team of 75 employees, the company expects to “generate 8-9 figures in net profit in 2025.”
Several crypto enthusiasts had taken to social media to ask how the logistics would work for Mallers, being the CEO of Strike and Twenty One Capital.

Crypto commentator “Alex” asked in an April 25 X post, “What will be the fate of Strike? New incoming CEO? Or will he pull an Elon Musk?” Similarly, Domingo Guerra asked, “Who will be running Strike!?”
Meanwhile, several crypto industry participants have publicly speculated that Twenty One Capital may acquire Strike in the future. Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said it is “probably safe to assume that this company will acquire strike.” 
Daniel Sempere Pico said, “How long before Twenty One acquires Strike?” However, neither Mallers or Strike has indicated any intention of doing so.

>>>>>>> cc64ad84e2cd536574265965e31ed4b4787dbfc9
Key points:
Bitcoin price pushed above $95,000, increasing the chance of a rally to $100,000.
Institutional investor demand is back, suggesting that the bearish trend could be over.
Select altcoins could break above their respective overhead resistance levels if Bitcoin remains strong
Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are trying to sustain the price above $95,000, but they are likely to face significant resistance from the bears. Will buyers succeed in pushing the price toward the psychologically important level of $100,000, or is a pullback around the corner? That is the big question on the traders’ minds.
A positive sign is that inflows for US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have increased since April 21, per Farside Investors data. Coinbase Institutional head of strategy John D’Agostino said in a recent interview with CNBC that several institutions purchased Bitcoin in April to hedge against currency inflation and macro uncertainty as Bitcoin mirrors “the characteristics of gold.
However, some analysts doubt the sustainability of the current Bitcoin rally. One of the red flags is that the sentiment, as measured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, slipped from a score of 72 out of 100 on April 23 to 60 on April 25, though Bitcoin is trading close to $95,000. Select analysts expect Bitcoin to pullback toward $87,000. 
Could Bitcoin sustain above $95,000, triggering buying in altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
Bitcoin has been trading near the $95,000 level, suggesting that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate a move higher.
The 20-day exponential moving average ($87,437) is sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the overbought zone, signaling that the bulls are in command. A close above $95,000 could drive the BTC/USDT pair to $100,000. 
Sellers will try to halt the up move at $100,000, but if the bulls do not allow the price to dip below $95,000, the prospects of a break above the overhead resistance increase. The pair may then climb to $107,000. The bears will have to yank the price below the moving averages to regain control.
Ether’s (ETH) relief rally is facing resistance at the 50-day SMA ($1,812), but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($1,696).
The 20-day EMA is flattish, but the RSI has jumped into the positive zone, signaling a slight advantage to the bulls. If the 50-day SMA is scaled, the ETH/USDT pair could reach the breakdown level of $2,111. The bears may pose a strong challenge at $2,111, but if the bulls overcome it, the pair could skyrocket to $2,550.
Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If they can pull it off, the pair could tumble toward $1,537.
XRP (XRP) has been trading near the 50-day SMA ($2.18) for the past two days, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level.
A minor positive for the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to skid below the 20-day EMA ($2.13). The bulls will again try to propel the XRP/USDT pair to the resistance line, which is a critical level to watch out for. The pair could rally to $3 if buyers pierce the resistance line.
On the downside, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bears remain in charge. The downside momentum could pick up on a break below $2. The pair may then plummet to $1.60.
BNB (BNB) turned down from $620 but is taking support at the moving averages. This suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.
Buyers will try to push the price above $620. If they manage to do that, the BNB/USDT pair may rally to $644. Sellers will try to stall the up move at the $644 level, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could soar to $680.
This bullish view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. That could sink the pair to $566, indicating that the markets have rejected the breakout above the downtrend line.
Solana (SOL) is struggling to stay above the $153 level, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.
The upsloping 20-day EMA ($136) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate that the bulls are in control. If buyers push and maintain the price above $153, the SOL/USDT pair could jump to $180.
The moving averages are the crucial support on the downside. A break and close below the 50-day SMA ($129) suggests that the pair could consolidate between $153 and $110 for a few days.
Dogecoin (DOGE) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.16) on April 24, indicating that the bulls are buying on dips.
The DOGE/USDT pair could reach $0.21, which is a crucial resistance to watch out for. If buyers pierce the $0.21 level, the pair will complete a double-bottom pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective of $0.28.
Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, the pair may remain range-bound between $0.21 and $0.14 for a while. The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears on a break below the $0.14 support.
Cardano (ADA) closed above the 50-day SMA ($0.68) on April 23, signaling that the bears are losing their grip.
The 20-day EMA ($0.65) has started to turn up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside. The ADA/USDT pair could rally to $0.83, where the bears may step in.
Any pullback is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it signals a bullish sentiment. Sellers will have to drag the price below the 20-day EMA to sink the pair to $0.58.
Related: SUI's 73% weekly price gains top crypto market — New price record in reach?
Sui (SUI) picked up momentum after buyers pushed the price above the moving averages on April 22.
The rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI into the overbought territory, suggesting a minor consolidation or correction in the next few days. Any pullback is expected to find support in the zone between the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $3.14 and the 50% retracement of $2.94.
A shallow pullback increases the possibility of a rally to $4.25 and then to $5. Sellers will be back in the driver’s seat if they pull the SUI/USDT pair below $2.86.
Chainlink (LINK) has started a recovery, which is expected to face strong selling at the overhead resistance of $16.
If the price turns down from $16, it is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA ($13.53). A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA increases the likelihood of a break above $16. The LINK/USDT pair may then climb to the resistance line of the descending channel pattern. A break above the channel signals a potential trend change.
Sellers will have to tug the price below the moving averages to regain control. The pair may then drop to $11.89 and eventually to the support line.
Avalanche (AVAX) is facing resistance at the overhead resistance of $23.50, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.
The 20-day EMA ($20.22) has started to turn up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that buyers have the edge. If the price breaks and closes above $23.50, the AVAX/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern. That could open the doors for a rally to the pattern target of $31.73.
Alternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, the pair could remain stuck inside the $23.50 to $15.27 range for a few days.

934555077f8cafbceb4e5f36bd81f71c,Cointelegraph,"Bretton Woods institutions must reorient, US Treasury secretary says",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bessent-calls-bretton-woods-institutions-reorient," Scott Bessent said institutions such as the IMF and World Bank must correct trade imbalances and protect the value of fiat currencies against exchange rate risks. 
United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently called for “Bretton Woods institutions,” such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to reorient themselves, a signal that the global monetary order could be shifting.
Speaking at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) on April 23, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to correct trade imbalances and protect the value of fiat currencies against exchange rate risk.
""The Bretton Woods institutions must step back from their sprawling and unfocused agendas,"" Bessent said. He added:
Bessent's call for the IMF to correct trade imbalances between countries, specifically the US and China, coincides with a decline in the US dollar to three-year lows, $36 trillion in US government debt, and stiff economic competition from China.
Investor and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio argues that the world is experiencing a global macroeconomic shift that will upend the post-WWII financial order and eventually replace the US dollar as the global reserve currency, potentially with a digital form of money.

The Bretton Woods Agreement was signed in 1944 and pegged the currencies of 44 countries to the value of the US dollar, which, at that point, was pegged to the value of gold at $35 per ounce.
Eliminating complex foreign exchange risks between freely floating currencies to make global trade more efficient was the primary goal of the agreement.
In August 1971, US President Richard Nixon announced the end of the dollar's convertibility to gold — formally ending the Bretton Woods agreement in a move that was supposed to be temporary.
“Your dollar will be worth just as much tomorrow as it does today,” Nixon incorrectly told Americans during his now-infamous address.
The IMF and the World Bank, which were spawned from the Bretton Woods agreement, continue operating in an attempt to curb the effects of free-floating fiat currencies on the foreign exchange market.
Speaking at the White House Digital Asset Summit on March 7, Bessent said stablecoins could drive international demand for US dollars and US government debt instruments.
Bessent added that the Trump administration will use stablecoins to protect the US dollar and its status as the global reserve currency.
Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser argued against this plan, predicting that gold-backed stablecoins would outcompete dollar-pegged tokens due to the desire for low-volatility, inflation-resistant money.
In March this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote that the $36 trillion US national debt could drive investors to Bitcoin (BTC) as market participants start to see BTC as a better store of value than the US dollar.
Bitwise executive Jeff Park voiced a similar prediction in February, focused on the effects of US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs.
The analyst wrote that the tumult from the ongoing trade war would cause worldwide inflation, which would cause individuals to seek alternative stores of value like Bitcoin, driving its price much higher in the long term.

b2e86ead374aa36828498796cee2b07f,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin rebounds as bulls eye $100K and bears scramble to cover short positions,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rallies-as-bulls-eye-100-k-and-bears-rush-to-cover-shorts," Bitcoin bears are at risk of deep losses as soaring inflows to the spot BTC ETFs highlight the return of institutional investor demand. 
Key takeaways: 
Bearish Bitcoin traders were caught off guard by BTC’s rally above $90,000.
Spot volumes are driving the Bitcoin price rally.
Derivatives positions with a bearish bias remain at risk of liquidation.
Bitcoin (BTC) held above the $93,000 mark on April 24, suggesting a potential conclusion to the 52-day bear market that bottomed at $74,400. Although Bitcoin is beginning to show signs of decoupling from the stock market, professional traders have not altered their strategies, as indicated by BTC futures and margin market data.
A higher long-to-short ratio reflects a preference for long (buy) positions, while a lower ratio indicates a tilt toward short (sell) contracts. Currently, the top traders’ long-to-short ratio on Binance stands at 1.5x, a notable decrease from the 2x level observed ten days earlier. At OKX, the ratio peaked near 1.1x on April 17 but has since lost momentum and now sits at 0.9x.
Bitcoin’s 10% rally between April 20 and April 24 coincided with a more conciliatory stance from US President Donald Trump regarding import tariffs and his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who has faced scrutiny for maintaining high interest rates. On April 24, Trump stated he had “no intention” of firing Powell, marking a notable shift from his previous rhetoric.
Amid economic uncertainty, Deutsche Bank strategists have reduced their year-end S&P 500 target by 12% to 6,150. Meanwhile, the US dollar has weakened against other major currencies, pushing the DXY index below 99 for the first time in three years. Despite a modest 6% gain over the past 30 days, Bitcoin’s performance has secured it a place among the world’s top eight tradable assets, with a market capitalization of $1.84 trillion.
The sharp move above $90,000 caught Bitcoin bears off guard, resulting in over $390 million in leveraged short (sell) futures liquidations between April 21 and April 22. More significantly, aggregate open interest in BTC futures remains just 5% below its all-time high, indicating that bearish traders have not fully exited their positions.
If Bitcoin’s price maintains its upward momentum and breaks above $95,000, an additional $700 million in short (sell) futures positions could be liquidated, according to CoinGlass data. This potential short squeeze may prove especially challenging for bears, given the robust inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which totaled over $2.2 billion between April 21 and April 23.
A newly announced joint venture involving SoftBank, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Tether aims to accumulate Bitcoin through convertible bonds and equity financing, which could further strengthen the bullish case. Named “Twenty One Capital,” the Bitcoin treasury company is led by Strike founder Jack Mallers and plans to launch with 42,000 BTC.

The muted response from top traders in BTC margin and futures markets suggests that the recent buying pressure has originated mainly from spot markets, which is generally considered a positive indicator for a sustainable bull run.
The longer Bitcoin consolidates above $90,000, the greater the pressure on bears to cover their shorts, as this level reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is decoupling from the stock market. This could provide the confidence needed to challenge the $100,000 psychological threshold.

a1d34ef0840cbb053f3c7d3771b0bcb1,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin supply on exchanges is falling ‘due to public company purchases’ — Fidelity,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-supply-exchanges-falling-public-company-purchases-fidelity," BTC reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have fallen to the lowest level since November 2018. 
Bitcoin reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have dropped to their lowest level in more than six years, as publicly traded companies ramp up their accumulation of the digital asset following the US presidential election, according to Fidelity Digital Assets. 
“We have seen Bitcoin supply on exchanges dropping due to public company purchases — something we anticipate accelerating in the near future,” Fidelity reported on the X social media platform.
Fidelity said the supply of Bitcoin (BTC) on exchanges had fallen to roughly 2.6 million BTC, the lowest since November 2018. More than 425,000 BTC have moved off exchanges since November, a trend often viewed as a signal of long-term investment rather than short-term trading.
Over the same period, publicly-traded companies acquired nearly 350,000 BTC, Fidelity said.
Fidelity Digital Assets is a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, the $5.8 trillion asset manager headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The Fidelity Digital subsidiary was established in 2018, long before cryptocurrency was considered an institutional asset class. 
Fidelity is the issuer of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, one of the first 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved in the United States.

While Fidelity noted significant corporate Bitcoin purchases, most of the accumulation has been driven by Strategy, the business intelligence firm-turned-Bitcoin bank co-founded by Michael Saylor.
Since November, Strategy has acquired 285,980 BTC, accounting for 81% of the approximately 350,000 BTC purchased by publicly traded companies.
Strategy’s latest purchase of 6,556 BTC was disclosed on April 21. 
Outside the United States, publicly traded companies in Asia have adopted a similar Bitcoin treasury strategy, with Japan’s Metaplanet and Hong Kong’s HK Asia Holdings increasing their Bitcoin allocations. 
Metaplanet currently holds 5,000 BTC, with CEO Simon Gerovich saying his goal is to double that amount this year.
Meanwhile, HK Asia Holdings announced plans to raise roughly $8.35 million to potentially increase its Bitcoin reserves.

b208085932c4715f39885a1547edc622,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin 'short squeeze' or $87K dip next? BTC price predictions vary,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-short-squeeze-87k-dip-btc-price-predictions-vary," Bitcoin could liquidate a large block of leveraged shorts with a trip above its yearly open, but BTC price dip expectations are building as traders eye $87,000. 
Bitcoin is setting up a showdown with leveraged shorts immediately above its yearly open price.
That key level near $93,500 is the main target for traders hoping that BTC/USD will cement its latest breakout.
The next support retest could involve $87,000, analysis suggests.
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated below a key resistance target on April 24 as a BTC price forecast brought sub-$90,000 levels into play.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD retesting $92,000 as support overnight.
The pair broadly maintained six-week highs while global markets remained at a loss over the trajectory of the ongoing US trade war.
“The market is now up over +1% on the day on no news at all,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter summarized alongside a chart of the S&P 500 in part of its latest analysis on X.
Bitcoin continued to brush off news events, leaving volatility to equities, while gold attempted to stabilize after slipping from record highs earlier in the week.
“Fairly normal to have a slight correction here on Bitcoin as it's just had a massive breakout,” crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe told X followers on the day.
Others increasingly entertained the idea of a deeper correction following brisk gains for BTC/USD, potentially taking the market back below the $90,000 mark.
“A dip to 88k would be lovely,” popular trader Inmortal argued. 
A dip to 88k would be lovely.If the market gives it, I will probably play one of these two setups, or both.$BTC pic.twitter.com/ysqiheds7X
Trader and analyst Rekt Capital had a similar conception of the potential support retest move.
BTC price action, he observed, was closely copying behavior from the middle of its previous bull market in 2021.
“Part of Bitcoin continuing to repeat mid-2021 price tendencies relative to the Bull Market EMAs would be a dip into the $87000 (green EMA) level for a post-breakout retest, if at all needed,” he commented on a weekly chart showing two exponential moving averages (EMAs).
The main target for bulls thus remained the yearly open level just above $93,000, one which remained intact as resistance at the time of writing.

This coincided with a block of potential liquidation levels on exchange order books, providing fertile conditions for a “short squeeze” should price attack them.

The latest data from monitoring resource CoinGlass showed the largest concentration of liquidation leverage centered around $93,600.
Earlier, Cointelegraph reported on a large trading entity dubbed “Spoofy the Whale” removing a wall of asks at $90,000.

db2bd407cb66185cf1ad8c71ce31c1da,Cointelegraph,The hidden risk of updatable firmware,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-hidden-risk-of-updatable-firmware," Crypto’s hidden threat: firmware updates in hardware wallets can be ticking time bombs, introducing vulnerabilities and backdoors. 
Opinion by: Igor Zemtsov, chief technology officer at TBCC
Crypto security is a ticking time bomb. Updatable firmware might just be the match that lights the fuse.
Hardware wallets have become the holy grail of self-custody, the ultimate safeguard against hackers, scammers and even government overreach. There’s an inconvenient truth, however, that most people ignore: Firmware updates aren’t just security patches. 
They’re potential backdoors, waiting for someone — whether a hacker, a rogue developer or a shady third party — to kick them wide open.
Every time a hardware wallet manufacturer pushes an update, users are forced to make a choice. Hit that update button and hope for the best, or refuse to update and risk using outdated software with unknown vulnerabilities. Either way, it’s a gamble. 
In crypto, a bad gamble can mean waking up to an empty wallet.
Updating firmware sounds like common sense. More security! Fewer bugs! Better user experience!
Here’s the thing: Every update is also an opportunity not just for the wallet provider but for anyone with the power, or motivation, to tamper with the process.
Hackers dream of firmware vulnerabilities. A rushed or poorly audited update can introduce tiny, almost imperceptible flaws — ones that sit in the background, waiting for the right moment to drain funds. And the best part? Users will never know what hit them.
Then there’s the more unsettling possibility: deliberate backdoors.
Recent: Hardware wallet Ledger helps competitor Trezor resolve security vulnerability
Tech companies have been forced to include government-mandated surveillance tools before. What makes anyone think hardware wallet makers are exempt? If a regulatory agency — or worse, a criminal organization — wants access to private keys, firmware updates are the perfect attack vector. One hidden function. One disguised line of code. 
That’s all it takes. Still think firmware updates are harmless? 
This isn’t some far-fetched, doomsday scenario. It has already happened.
Ledger, one of the biggest names in crypto security, had a major security crisis in 2018 when security researcher Saleem Rashid exposed a vulnerability that allowed attackers to replace Ledger Nano S firmware and hijack private keys. Nearly 1 million devices were at risk before a fix was rolled out. The scary part? There was no way for users to know if their devices had already been compromised.
In 2023, OneKey suffered a similar nightmare. White hat hackers demonstrated that its firmware could be cracked in mere seconds. No crypto was lost — this time. But what if real attackers had found the flaw first?
Then came the “Dark Skippy” exploit, taking firmware-based attacks to an entirely new level. With just two signed transactions, hackers could extract a user’s entire seed phrase — without setting off a single alarm. If firmware updates can be manipulated this easily, how can anyone be sure their assets are safe?
To be fair, not all firmware updates are security disasters. Ledger uses a proprietary operating system and secure element chips for added protection now. Trezor takes an open-source approach, allowing the community to scrutinize its firmware. Coldcard and BitBox02 give users manual control over updates, reducing — but not eliminating — risk.
Here’s the real question: Can users ever be 100% sure that an update won’t introduce a fatal flaw?
Some wallets have decided to eliminate the risk altogether. Tangem ships with fixed, non-updatable firmware, meaning that its code can never be altered once the device leaves the factory. No updates. No patches. 
Of course, this approach has its trade-offs. If a vulnerability is discovered, there’s no way to fix it. But in security, predictability matters. 
The crypto market was worth $2.79 trillion as of March 2025. With that much money on the table, cybercriminals, rogue insiders and overreaching governments are always looking for weak points. Hardware wallet makers should be laser-focused on security.
Choosing a hardware wallet shouldn’t feel like gambling with private keys. It shouldn’t involve blind trust in a corporation’s ability to push updates responsibly. Users deserve more than vague reassurances. They deserve security models that put control where it belongs — with them.
Security isn’t about convenience. It’s about control. Any system that requires trusting unknown developers, opaque update processes or firmware that can be changed at will? That’s not control. That’s a liability.
The only real way to keep a hardware wallet safe? Remove the guesswork. Strip away the blind trust. Always research the developers’ backgrounds, check their track record for security incidents, and see how they’ve handled past vulnerabilities. Stick to verifiable facts — security should never be based on assumptions.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

Bitcoin’s price trajectory may be suppressed ahead of its upcoming “omega candle” rally, according to Prince Filip Karađorđević, the hereditary prince of Serbia and Yugoslavia.
In an April 24 interview with Simply Bitcoin, Filip said some market participants may be limiting Bitcoin (BTC) price action.
“People are able to control the market to some extent,” he said. “Maybe that’s what acted on the 2021 market that suppressed its price from jumping high up. We could get that again in 2025, but there will be one point where [Bitcoin price] will run away.”
Filip added that Bitcoin remains a fundamentally deflationary asset and said its value is “always going to rise over time.”
He referenced the concept of the “omega candle,” made popular by Bitcoin advocate and Jan3 CEO Samson Mow. The theory predicts Bitcoin’s growth trajectory will explode after it hits the $100,000 mark.

“You’ll start to go up by 10,000 a day or drop by 10,000 a day. And this is the God candle. After that, we’ll start to see omega candles, which are 100,000 increments daily,” said Mow in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph in November 2024.
Factors contributing to Bitcoin’s growth include the growing distrust in the traditional financial system, according to Mow.

Bitcoin price saw an over 9% recovery over the past week as the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) accumulated over $2.2 billion worth of Bitcoin in the three days leading up to April 23, Farside Investors’ data shows.
The price action is in line “with our Bitcoin relative strength expectations with respect to equities and the dollar,” analysts from Bitfinex exchange told Cointelegraph, adding:
Bitcoin may continue to see more upside if “equities continue higher during earnings week,” but the “still-elevated macro uncertainty could limit broad-based upside,” the analysts added.
Stock and cryptocurrency investors are also concerned about a potential recession in the US. JPMorgan estimates a 60% probability for a recession in 2025, citing US President Donald Trump’s 145% tariffs on China as a “material threat to growth” that increases the odds of an economic downturn.

12dffdc428639b44180193803018498a,Cointelegraph,How crypto payments can become the new ‘tap-and-go’ — Pulsar co-founder,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-crypto-payments-can-become-the-new-tap-and-go-pulsar-co-founder," This episode of the Clear Crypto Podcast breaks down how social payments and crypto giveaways on X can make blockchain-based transactions fast, fun and finally mainstream. 
What if paying with crypto was as easy and as fun as sending a meme on X?
In the latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, StarkWare’s Nathan Jeffay and Cointelegraph’s Gareth Jenkinson sit down with Stefana Banciu, growth lead at Pulsar Money, to explore how blockchain is bringing payments into the digital age, with speed, transparency and a dash of playfulness.
Banciu lays out how Pulsar is pushing the frontier of Web3 payments with features like social transfers that allow users to send crypto directly through X, simply by tagging a handle. 
The episode cuts through the crypto jargon to tackle a question with mainstream resonance: Why aren’t we using crypto for everyday transactions yet?
“I wish I could say yes, but that wouldn’t be a true reflection of the state of affairs,” Jenkinson admits when asked if crypto is widely used for payments. He points to Mastercard-linked crypto cards as a stopgap, but says the real revolution hasn’t yet reached the coffee shop counter.

For Banciu, the path forward lies in bridging fun and fundamentals. While crypto’s founding ideals include borderless, permissionless transfers and low fees, she says onboarding the next wave of users will require experiences that are intuitive, social and entertaining.
Their platform includes a “social payments module” that lets users send crypto directly through X by tagging a handle, a small but powerful step toward making transactions feel more like communication than banking.
“You can actually send funds directly on Twitter,” Banciu says.
But convenience alone isn’t enough. Banciu says making crypto fun is key to onboarding the next wave of users. 
“We all know within the crypto space, the whole community that is here for perhaps something else than payments, which is quite boring, right?” she adds. “So we said, OK, why not think of a way to onboard users, make them do payments in a fun way?”
For Jenkinson, making crypto usable as a true “medium of exchange” is essential to its legitimacy.

5548915a06eb634979bce4f89f1acb89,Cointelegraph,New Hampshire Bitcoin reserve bill heads to full Senate vote,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-hampshire-bitcoin-reserve-bill-clears-senate-committee," New Hampshire’s House Bill 302 would allow the state treasurer to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion. 
A bill that would allow New Hampshire to invest a portion of its state funds in digital assets and precious metals has advanced to a full Senate vote after passing a second committee.
On April 23, House Bill 302 (HB 302) was reviewed in the second Senate committee and passed in a 4-1 vote.
The legislation, introduced in January, cleared the New Hampshire House earlier this month in a 192–179 vote. It now faces a vote by the full Senate and, if approved, will require the governor’s signature to become law.
Once enacted, it would allow the New Hampshire treasury to use 10% of the state’s general funds to invest in crypto with a market cap of over $500 billion — a threshold currently met only by Bitcoin (BTC).
During a debate before the full House vote, Democratic Representative Terry Spahr argued that the bill is unnecessary. 
The lawmaker said it could undermine the future security of the state’s digital asset stockpile. Spahr argued that the state treasurer already has the authority to manage investments without the bill.
Others said that it could earn the state good returns for its investment. Republican Representative Jordan Ulery said the investments could net the state a “large amount of money.”

Bitcoin Laws, which tracks the progress of digital asset legislation, shows that New Hampshire also has two more blockchain-related bills going through its legislature. 
HB 639 addresses blockchain dispute resolution and regulatory frameworks, while HB 310 focuses on real-world asset tokenization and stablecoin usage.
New Hampshire’s progress comes as Arizona pursues a more aggressive approach by exploring the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, aiming to become the first US state to implement the policy.

Asian investment firms are stepping up their Bitcoin accumulation strategies, with Japan’s Metaplanet and Hong Kong’s HK Asia Holdings leading the way.
Tokyo-based Metaplanet disclosed on April 24 that it acquired an additional 145 Bitcoin (BTC) for 1.9 billion Japanese yen (around $13.4 million), boosting its total holdings to 5,000 BTC.
Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich confirmed the company had reached 50% of its initial goal of amassing 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025.
The firm has been aggressive in its Bitcoin treasury operations, using bond issuances and Bitcoin income strategies such as selling cash-secured BTC put options to finance its acquisitions.
Since initiating its Bitcoin strategy, Metaplanet’s stock has surged over 3,000%. The company aims to hold 21,000 BTC by the close of 2026.

HK Asia Holdings has also announced plans to raise about $65 million Hong Kong dollars ($8.35 million) by issuing new shares and convertible notes to potentially buy more BTC.
According to an April 23 filing, the company entered into share subscription and convertible note (CN) subscription agreements after trading hours.
The deal includes issuing 3,272,000 new shares at a subscription price of HK$4.01 per share, alongside convertible notes valued at HK$52.38 million in aggregate principal amount. The newly issued shares will represent about 0.82% of HK Asia Holdings’ total shares in circulation.
While the filing does not mention that HK Asia Holdings intends to use the funds to buy Bitcoin, many in the crypto community speculated that the capital raise is expected to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions.
The speculation follows HK Asia’s February decision to step into Bitcoin markets. After buying its first BTC on Feb. 16, the firm doubled its share price within a day.
By Feb. 20, HK Asia expanded its holdings by purchasing an additional 7.88 BTC, bringing its total to nearly 9 BTC at an average price of $97,021 per coin.
Shares in HK Asia were up by around 5.4% on April 24 at the Hong Kong stock market closing, according to Google Finance.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the world’s largest publicly listed corporate Bitcoin holder, has championed the Bitcoin accumulation strategy by consistently issuing convertible notes and at-the-market (ATM) equity offerings to fund aggressive Bitcoin purchases.
In February, Strategy announced plans to raise another $2 billion through 0% senior convertible notes to purchase more Bitcoin.
As of April 20, Strategy held 538,200 BTC on its balance sheet. The figure includes the company’s most recent acquisition of 6,556 BTC for about $555.8 million.

aa0dd8d87acf52650886bfff44f66cae,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin's next big resistance is $95K— What will trigger the breakout?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-next-big-resistance-is-95k-what-will-trigger-breakout," Decreasing Bitcoin exchange inflows, resurgent ETF demand and other bullish factors could push BTC price above the next big hurdle at $95,000. 
Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows are at their highest since January 2025.
Inflows to exchanges down to levels last seen in December 2016.
Bitcoin’s negative funding rates could set up a short squeeze.
BTC price is above major moving averages, which can now provide support.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose to a new range high at $94,700 on April 23, its highest value since March 2.
Several analysts said the next psychological resistance remains at $95,000, and the price might drop to test support levels below.
“The $94K–$95K zone is clearly the resistance to beat,” said Swissblock in an April 24 post on X. 
The onchain data provider asserted that the next logical move for Bitcoin would be a pullback toward the $90,000 zone to gain momentum for a move higher.
Popular Bitcoin analyst AlphaBTC opined that the asset will likely consolidate in the $93,000-$95,000 range “before pushing higher to take liquidity above 100K.”
Several bullish signs suggest that BTC is well-positioned to break above $95,000 in the following days or weeks.
One factor supporting the Bitcoin bull argument is resurgent institutional demand, reflected by significant inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
On April 22 and April 23, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net flow totaling $936 million and $917 million, respectively, as per data from SoSoValue.
As Cointelegraph reported, these inflows have been the highest since January 2025 and more than 500 times the 2025 daily average.
This trend reflects growing confidence among traditional finance players, as observed by market analysts like Jamie Coutts, who noted global liquidity hitting new all-time highs, historically fueling asset price rallies. 
Institutional buying creates sustained upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price by absorbing the available supply.
The trend of decreasing Bitcoin exchange inflows continues, suggesting a potential reduction in sell pressure. 
The total amount of coins transferred to the exchanges has dropped from a year-to-date high of 97,940 BTC per day on Feb. 25 to 45,000 BTC on April 23, as per data from CryptoQuant. 
This is reinforced by a reduction in the number of addresses depositing Bitcoin to exchanges, which has been “steadily declining since 2022,” according to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. 
He highlights that this metric’s 30-day moving average has dropped to 52,000 BTC, a level last seen in December 2016. 
“This trend is bullish in itself,” as it represents a fourfold reduction in coin sales over the last three years, the analyst said, adding:
Bitcoin price has rebounded to levels last seen in early March, but futures trades are not entirely on board yet. 
Bitcoin’s perpetual futures funding rates remained negative between April 22 and April 23, despite the price rising by 11% over the same period, data from Glassnode shows.
Negative funding rates imply that shorts are paying longs, reflecting a bearish sentiment that can fuel a short squeeze as prices rise.

In an April 22 post on X, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost highlighted a similar divergence in Bitcoin’s price and Binance funding rates. 
“Whereas BTC continues to climb, funding rates on Binance have turned negative, currently sitting at around -0.006 at the time of writing,” Darkfost explained.
He added that this is a rare occurrence, which has historically been followed by significant rallies, like Bitcoin’s surge from $28,000 to $73,000 in October 2023, and from $57,000 to $108,000 in September 2024.
If history repeats itself, Bitcoin may rally from the current levels, breaking above the resistance at $95,000 toward $100,000.
On April 22, Bitcoin price rose above a key level: the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) currently at $88,690, fueling a marketwide recovery.
The last time the BTC price broke above the 200-day SMA, it experienced a parabolic move, rallying 80% from $66,000 on Oct. 14, 2024, to its previous all-time high of $108,000 on Dec. 17. 
This level should provide significant support as Bitcoin trades above this key trendline. But if it doesn’t hold, the following levels to watch will likely be $84,379, the 50-day SMA, and the $80,000 psychological level.
For the bulls, the resistance levels at $95,000 and $100,000 are the primary ones to watch. Rising above that would pave the way for a run toward the Jan. 20 all-time high above $109,000.

Semler Scientific has bought approximately $10 million worth of Bitcoin since Feb. 14, the healthcare technology company said in an April 25 statement. 
The company purchased 111 Bitcoin (BTC) for $10 million at an average price of roughly $90,000 per coin, Semler said. It holds a total of more than 3,300 Bitcoin worth approximately $300 million in aggregate. 
Semler said its Bitcoin purchases have earned stockholders a Bitcoin yield of 23.5% in the year to date. Bitcoin yield measures the ratio of BTC holdings to outstanding shares, reflecting growing exposure per share for investors. 
“Semler Scientific uses BTC Yield as a [key performance indicator] to help assess the performance of its strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner Semler Scientific believes is accretive to stockholders,” it said. 
The company said it acquired its Bitcoin treasury for an average price of nearly $89,000. As of April 25, Bitcoin trades at approximately $95,000 per coin, according to data from Cointelegraph. 
Semler Scientific is a healthcare technology company that develops and sells medical diagnostic products, with a primary focus on detecting chronic diseases. The company has partially financed its Bitcoin purchases by issuing roughly $125 million in new stock, it said. Semler also announced plans to raise $75 million through the private offering of convertible senior notes in January.

In 2024, Bitcoin’s surging price pushed Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) up more than 350%, according to data from FinanceCharts. Strategy’s success has inspired dozens of other companies, such as Semler, to start accumulating Bitcoin treasuries. 
Public companies are now among the largest institutional Bitcoin holders. As of April 25, corporate Bitcoin holdings are worth approximately $71 billion in the aggregate, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET.
Strategy is still the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with a treasury worth more than $50 billion. During the week of April 14, Strategy bagged 6,556 Bitcoin for an average price of $84,785 per coin.
Among institutional buyers, corporate treasuries still lag exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which cumulatively hold approximately $110 billion in Bitcoin as of April 25, according to Coinglass data.

Cryptocurrency firms and centralized exchanges are launching more traditional investment offerings, bridging the divide between traditional financial and digital assets.
With investors seeking more flexible product offerings under one platform, the “line is blurring” between traditional finance (TradFi) and the cryptocurrency space, as the two financial paradigms signal a “growing synergy,” according to Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, the world’s sixth-largest crypto exchange.
In the wider crypto space, Securitize partnered with Mantle protocol to launch an institutional fund that will generate yield on a basket of diverse cryptocurrencies, similar to how traditional index funds track a mix of stocks.
The developments come after crypto investor sentiment staged a significant recovery, moving from “fear” to “neutral” for the first time since January 2025.
Investor sentiment was bolstered after US President Donald Trump said that import tariffs on Chinese goods will “come down substantially,” adopting a softer tone in negotiations for the first time since the reciprocal tariff announcement.
Cryptocurrency firms and exchanges are increasingly moving into Wall Street territory, launching more traditional investment offerings and showcasing the increasing connection between crypto and traditional finance (TradFi).
“There’s a growing synergy between traditional financial investments and the emerging crypto space,” according to Gracy Chen, the CEO of Bitget, the world’s sixth-largest crypto exchange.
“Crypto players are now checking out traditional finance as they see the opportunity to bridge it,” Chen told Cointelegraph.
“The lines are blurring. Investors want flexibility, and products that can straddle both worlds are naturally attractive,” Chen said. “Some players see TradFi as a safety net; others, like Bitget, see it as a launchpad for broader adoption.” She added:

The fund also integrates liquid staking tokens — including Mantle’s mETH, Bybit’s bbSOL, and Ethena’s USDe — in a bid to enhance returns with onchain yield, according to the announcement.
The launch comes as retail and institutions alike increase exposure to cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a hedge amid escalating macroeconomic uncertainty.

Mantra founder and CEO John Patrick Mullin has started unstaking 150 million of his Mantra (OM) tokens in preparation for sending them to a burn address in an attempt to restore the token’s value by tightening supply. 
Mantra announced on April 21 that the unstaking process had begun, and would be completed by April 29, at which point Mullin's Mantra (OM) tokens will be sent to the burn address and permanently removed from circulating supply.
Mullin said it was a “first step in rebuilding trust with the community, but far from the last.” 
Mantra said it was also in talks with “key ecosystem partners” about burning a further 150 million OM to bring the total burn amount to 300 million.
With 150 million fewer OM, Mantra’s total supply will decline to 1.67 billion, and its number of staked tokens will drop by over 26% to 421.8 million OM from 571.8 million OM.

fd276e3227cfbb38dd08047e95fed687,Cointelegraph,"If Trump fired Powell, what would happen to crypto?",https://cointelegraph.com/news/if-trump-fired-powell-what-would-happen-to-crypto," A presidential assault on the Fed’s independence would send crypto into uncharted waters — and possibly vindicate its original thesis. 
Recent months have seen the ebb and flow of a certain pattern: US President Donald Trump will take some objectively harmful action to the US economy, and the markets will crash. Seeing this, Trump has turned to Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, and now demands he lower the Fed Funds Rate — the rate at which the Fed lends money to banks. And the steely eyed Powell will say “No.”
Trump wants to lower rates because doing so is an effective cash injection into the United States economy, stimulating activity and lifting the market. This, he believes, will make him appear successful. Powell wants to follow rigorous economic standards to set rates to carefully balance the Fed’s dual mandates of maximizing employment and maintaining stable prices. 
He also wants to maintain the Fed’s independence from political pressure and, crucially, maintain the Fed’s appearance of independence from political pressure. If the markets believe that the central bank’s independence has failed in the US, it may become more difficult to sell US Treasury Bills, the United States’ sovereign debt. That is a problem in the fundamental sense that the US will have to pay more to borrow money, making it poorer — but it is an especially acute problem now because the US already has an enormous, $30-trillion pile of debt which it has to periodically refinance.
If it is forced to refinance at higher rates because markets do not trust the US government anymore, then an ever greater percentage of GDP will be absorbed by the cost of interest, and, as the kids say, the United States will be cooked. 
That dance takes us to now. Last week, Trump repeatedly intimated that he would like to fire Powell, and the market didn’t like it. On Monday, Trump provoked a crash by calling Powell a “major loser” on Truth Social. In response, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly voiced concerns with the risks of firing Powell to Trump, who seems, for now, to have acquiesced, stating Tuesday that he would not fire his Fed chair. 
Still, this process feels more like a spiral than anything else, and many market watchers are waiting for the next shoe to drop. That forces the question: if Trump does go through with his base instincts and axes Powell, what will be the result? In particular, what effect will this have on the cryptocurrency industry?
It bears mentioning that the President is not supposed to be able to fire the Fed chair at will. Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 states that “each member shall hold office for a term of fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless sooner removed for cause by the President.”
This language may appear ambiguous, but in the 1935 case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution does not give the President an “illimitable power of removal” and so the President’s removal power is limited by statutory language. 
This decision ratified the concept of “independent agencies,” which reside within the executive branch, but have independent authority. While a number of agencies have this characteristic, including the SEC, the CFTC, and the FTC, the Fed is the most important.

Economists do not think much about the political control of central banks. Politicians have relatively short-term incentives, thinking in years or election cycles. This inherently pushes them to prefer short-termist policies, of which hot cash injections are the purest form. However, fiscal and monetary policy are delicate arts that often animate painful policy choices. 
In a classic example, Richard Nixon pressured then-Fed chair Arthur Burns to pursue expansionary monetary policy in the lead up to the 1972 election, believing that it would help his reelection odds. Nixon won that election in a landslide, but soon followed catastrophic “stagflation” that crippled the United States economy for a decade, and indeed may still be felt in the industries which hollowed out during that period. 
Contrast this with the policies of Paul Volcker, who, after this devastating period of stagflation, implemented a vicious series of rate increases between 1979 and 1987, which caused the “Volcker Shocks”, a series of painful recessions. However, the effect of this policy was to eventually strangle inflation and herald in the boom times of the 90s, facilitating Bill Clinton’s remarkable fiscal policy. 
No politician could have made these choices, none will in the future, and that is the rub. Economists — and, crucially, markets — believe deeply that the Fed must remain independent or else the entire economic fabric of American society risks collapse. This is no hyperbole — nations with politically controlled central banks like Weimar Germany, Peronist Argentina and Venezuela have experienced such crippling hyperinflation that it led variously to multigenerational geopolitical backsliding, reports of citizens starving and eating rats, and the rise of Adolph Hitler. This is serious stuff.
To fire Powell, Trump will first have to defeat the Humphrey's Executor precedent, a prospect that many legal scholars believe likely in light of the current Supreme Court composition. This is a Rubicon which, once crossed, marks a point of no return. Not just Trump, but every President who follows will have plenary legal authority to direct all executive officers — Fed Chair included — at their will. Most believe this will lead to ruin. 
But disaster or no, it will be a test for cryptocurrency. The original Bitcoin White Paper aimed to disintermediate financial transactions from “financial institutions serving as trusted third parties.” If the Fed falls, and US monetary policy is unmoored from sound judgment, the thesis of cryptocurrency’s early years will be put in stark relief. 
As Trump has provoked capital flight in recent weeks, investors have sought safety in various assets. Traditionally, any time there was a crisis, sophisticated parties fled risk assets into US Treasurys. The thinking was that these were riskless assets. Well, those days may be done. Ten year bond yields approached 5% during the peak of the Tariff Crisis and have not yet fully returned to previous lows. If Trump breaks the Fed, these outflows will be a drop in a bucket in a river, and that money may move into cryptocurrencies. 
Historically, the price of Bitcoin has tightly tracked the Nasdaq (albeit with a multiplier). However, since the Tariff Crisis, while US securities prices have remained largely depressed, Bitcoin has miraculously begun to pump. This has led some to speculate that we are witnessing the long-prophesied “decoupling”, wherein crypto-assets will fulfill their original purpose and move independently from centralized assets. 
It is impossible to say if this will or will not happen, but if Trump gives Powell the boot, we will find out for sure. 
Of course, world-historical collapse can’t be all good for crypto, and there will be significant pain across a variety of surfaces from this crisis as well. In the first instance, stablecoins will feel dire consequences almost immediately. 
In the last decade, two USD-denominated stablecoins — USDC and USDT — have dominated the market. Their issuers, Circle and Tether, are both important systemic institutions and major buyers of US Treasurys, which collateralize the majority of their stablecoin obligations. 
An immediate result of a Fed Crisis could be a Treasury default. The economist Noah Smith has speculated that Trump might try to write down the US’s sovereign debt:
“I suspect Trump will do something more like what he used to do as a businessman when his debt went bad — look for a cheap bailout, and if one doesn’t emerge, declare bankruptcy.”
Indeed, the President has hinted darkly at this prospect himself, in February suggesting that they might rely on pretense to mark the bills down:
""There could be a problem - you've been reading about that, with Treasuries and that could be an interesting problem…It could be that a lot of those things don't count. In other words, that some of that stuff that we're finding is very fraudulent, therefore maybe we have less debt than we thought.”

A sovereign default would immediately affect Circle and Tether by marking down the value of their collateral. This, in turn, could leave the stablecoins undercollateralized, which might provoke a bank run. The markets may ultimately stabilize, but events could easily turn the other way, leading to collapse of major stablecoins. 
This in turn would have numerous second-order effects, as smart contracts holding stables as collateral began liquidating positions, and contagion swept the rest of the market. 
Interestingly, these mechanical consequences may be less dire than the political costs of a Fed Crisis, because treasuries are not the only asset that has systemic importance to crypto. The US dollar has been the world's reserve currency for many, many years. There are lots of good reasons for this; it is relatively strong and stable, so it is good to settle trade with. But if the government backing it ceases to be strong and stable, this paradigm will likely shift. 
And as more trade is executed in euro or yuan-denominated accounts, regulators in the EU and China will, in turn, have much more control of the flows of fiat currency through cryptocurrency. One prominent cryptocurrency attorney, who chose not to be named for fear of political reprisal, speculated exactly this:
“​​I think China will fill a lot of the void and EU will fill most of the rest. Neither would be good for crypto generally between CCP and EU over-regulating in different ways for different goals. This seems bad.”
This might prompt flight to uncollateralized crypto-primitive assets, but there is essentially no precedent for such assets being used at scale for real-world transactions. It is just as likely that a stablecoin crisis could simply kneecap the industry for years as it is catching its stride.
Ultimately, nobody knows whether Trump will fire Powell, or even if he can. Nobody knows what consequences might flow downstream from his decisions. But if a butterfly flapping its wings in Argentina can cause a tornado in Prague, then Donald Trump muttering incantations in the West Wing might vindicate or destabilize the blockchain forever.
Like it or not, we’re all along for the ride.

8c0a9b14ed006a1563e5f88e7dc8ed55,Cointelegraph,Ethical finance must guide crypto’s evolution,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethical-finance-must-guide-crypto-s-evolution," As crypto’s speculative fervor wanes, it’s time for the industry to rediscover its roots in ethical finance. Ethical finance principles can steer the crypto industry toward meaningful innovation. 
Opinion by: Daniel Ahmed, co-founder of Fasset and founding member of the Own Foundation
Crypto was born from a vision to decentralize power, democratize finance and build systems where equity prevails over exploitation. Somewhere along the way, however, the movement lost its moral compass. As speculation surged, purpose dwindled.
We must return crypto to its decentralized roots, a technological revolution built on long-term value, inclusivity and ethics rather than cyclical, speculative gains. The industry should take inspiration from emerging regions and how ethical financial investing can help to repair some of the ways our industry has often fallen short. 
When Vitalik wrote a blog post on layer 2s as a cultural extension of Ethereum, he brought up a critical point not only in business and technology but humanity — what we build in this life should be more significant than ourselves. Citing blockchains, he described how layer 2s, which he framed as subcultures of Ethereum, don’t merely differ in their technical benefits but how their positioning and intricacies trickle down into the culture of their communities. 
In a space where new layer 2s are emerging rapidly, Vitalik’s insights are accurate and inspiring. When we build in a vacuum of echo chambers and monocultures, we miss out on the actual value of community in Web3. 
What really brings communities together? Too often in crypto, that answer has been making people rich. What it should be is shared ideals that solve real issues. If done with purpose and conviction, this can still make people money. 
While the rapid rise of layer 2 and layer 3 solutions promises scalability and efficiency, they are too often motivated by speculative gains rather than lasting value creation. If there’s any doubt, the numbers speak for themselves. 
Layer-2 fatigue aside, the sheer scope of this data raises the question: Is our industry innovating just because it can, or is it creating a real-world utility that improves the lives of fellow humans? There’s nothing wrong with building something to make money, but if that’s the only reason we’re building something, that’s a problem.
Recent: Islamic finance and Web3 take stage at Istanbul Blockchain Week
We need to shift the narrative and look at how Web3 is solving actual, fundamental issues in emerging markets — particularly in regions like the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa — as a north star for how to ethically build the future of our space. 
If crypto projects think innovation in Web3 is only about VC-led fundraising rounds, comparing transactions per second, or building the next great decentralized application to trade cat coins, they have probably never existed in a place where even the simplest of financial transactions is cumbersome. 
In emerging markets, where people grapple with inflation, high remittance fees and limited access to financial services, we’ve witnessed how meaningful effects can transform the daily lives of millions. These are not abstract issues. They affect business owners, families, students, creators and more. 
From stablecoins to secure and user-friendly payment applications, Web3 offers a unique opportunity to address these problems by creating decentralized financial systems that bypass the inefficiencies and inequities of traditional banking. For Web3 to truly make a difference in these regions, it must be designed with a focus on ethics, accessibility and long-term utility. We must lead by example. 
In these markets, if innovation doesn’t create a meaningful disruption that improves people’s lives and addresses real-world problems, it’s nothing more than a buzzword. The most powerful solutions in technology are those that solve the world’s greatest problems.
If you want inspiration, pay attention to those doing something different. If you want to inspire others, lead by example. 
Ethical finance, particularly Islamic finance, offers valuable lessons for Web3. Dating back to the 1960s and 70s in the Middle East and North Africa (and even further to around 620 AD), this sector is built on risk-sharing, ethical investment and a focus on tangible assets. 
Islamic finance has endured for centuries because it rejects speculation in favor of real, meaningful value. For example, we’ve seen the rise of ethical finance institutions like Al Rajhi Bank, one of the most prominent Islamic banks globally, known for its investments in tangible assets and community-oriented financial products. 
This model, which strives to build based on morals, substance and necessity versus mere financial opportunity, can guide Web3 as it moves beyond hype-driven growth.
As we look toward the next few years with the wind and a bull market beneath our wings, the time has come for Web3 to take a hard look in the mirror and redefine what success and innovation genuinely look like. The answer to this won’t be the same for everyone — that would be pretty boring if it were. 
We must find a common ground of shared values that extends beyond technical achievements, market capitalization, total value locked or X followers but strives to innovate something more significant than any layer 2 or token. 
When gearing up to launch something new, our industry must ask itself something that lives at the heart of Islamic finance: How will this product improve people’s lives? Is it true to the ethos of creating decentralized systems that are transparent, fair and built for the benefit of all?
If we can’t answer that, perhaps we should step back and ask why. Then, get back to work.

 The speed and severity of a flash crash can often be hard to understand. For the average investor, it sparks terror and perhaps confirms their deepest fears of their crypto stash becoming worthless. But with a calm head, the “tripwire” for a BTC crash is usually tied to a certain combination of interconnected factors. Let’s take a look at how flash crashes happen:Liquidation of leveraged positions when markets move unexpectedly. If leveraged traders can’t maintain their collateral during a big market drop, exchanges automatically sell their position to pay off the loan. When this happens on a large scale, it sends a wave of selling pressure through the market, crashing prices along the way.Algorithmic trading errors can cause a cascade of sell orders. Many traders use computer programs with preset rules. When these systems react to unusual market conditions, the trading bots can start selling aggressively. This then has a knock-on effect, sending sell signals and causing a chain reaction of automatic selling. Low market liquidity makes prices more sensitive to large trades. Think of this as far more active sellers than buyers. For BTC, it’s more prevalent on smaller exchanges where someone wants to sell a large amount quickly. They exhaust the available buy order immediately and cause a sudden BTC drop.Technical glitches in exchange infrastructure can cause trading to break down. It could be from servers going offline, data feeds freezing or order matching failing. This can lead to incorrect pricing displays and orders executing at extreme prices. Panic selling regularly occurs during scary news events. As the old trader’s saying goes, “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” When bad news breaks, markets could panic and everyone sells simultaneously, overwhelming buyers and sending prices plummeting.Did you know? In December 2024, BTC finally breached the elusive $100,000 mark but then tumbled back down to $94,000 within hours. In the process, over 200,000 traders were liquidated, causing losses of over $1 billion.

 The unfurling of a crypto market crash sends an icy stab through most investors’ bodies; of course, they are highly unfavorable market conditions in most scenarios. But once you’ve gotten over the initial shock, there can be some hidden benefits to explore. Exceptional buying conditions: While destructive for panicked investors, for those who are prepared, it offers a golden buying opportunity to buy BTC at a substantially discounted price. Market stress test: Assuming there is a quick recovery, these types of events serve as a stress test to get valuable insight into how markets react under extreme circumstances. Improved industry practices: It provides a learning opportunity for platforms like crypto exchanges to understand what went wrong and improve their infrastructure to avoid incidents in the future.Increased investor protection: Flash crashes attract the attention of mainstream media and regulators. This focus can be a catalyst for better regulation and protection for retail investors.Did you know? Despite its reputation for crashes and volatility, BTC now shows signs of becoming a mature asset. It can be less volatile than many well-known securities, such as the “Magnificent 7,” which includes Nvidia, Meta, Tesla and others.

 There have been several BTC flash crashes since the cryptocurrency was launched in 2009. Some of the biggest exchanges have seen prices evaporate in minutes, and market-wide crashes have left investors grappling with wiped-out portfolios. On June 19, 2011, the infamous Mt. Gox exchange was exposed to a database hack and compromised accounts. BTC’s price was pulverized from $17 down to $0.01, almost valueless. It was an early setback for Mt. Gox and BTC’s reputation, but it exposed early exchange vulnerability and showed the need for more robust infrastructure. More recently, on March 18, 2024, BTC flash crashed on BitMEX. While other exchanges were trading at over $60,000, the price on BitMEX crumbled down to $8,900. It all happened in just two minutes, but the recovery was swift, with prices rebounding to normal levels within 10 minutes. In addition, BTC-EUR prices on Coinbase briefly crashed from €63K to €48K, sharply diverging from other markets, as reported by Kaiko Research.CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Moreno, commented on the flash crash that saw Bitcoin briefly drop to around $88,800 on December 5, 2024. According to him, the flash crash was driven by a sell-off cascade and deleveraging in the BTC futures market, with open interest dropping as leveraged long positions were liquidated.COVID-19 was also responsible for a market-wide crash in March 2020 when the world’s most widely held crypto slid 50% in two days. The price collapsed from over $9,000 to below $4,000. It then took two months for market prices to return to previous levels.

 Flash crashes are almost impossible to accurately predict. When they strike, things happen quickly. Usually, the damage is done before a human can react, particularly when positions are liquidated and trading bots react to sell signals. But it is still possible to prepare and protect yourself against the fallout. Set up price alerts at key technical levels: This will help to alert you to unnatural market conditions so you are not caught off guard. Use leverage lightly; flash crashes burn highly leveraged traders instantly. So, don’t overexpose yourself to highly leveraged market positions.Learn to use a stop loss to protect capital. This enables you to sell your position early on in a crash, although they’re not foolproof, as a flash crash can fly past a stop loss in the worst cases. Keep spare capital in reserve to give you the ability to capitalize on low market prices when they arrive.Don’t keep the bulk of your holdings in an exchange account. Crashes can put platforms under severe financial stress, so try to self-custody your assets.As learned, flash crashes happen fast and can wipe out positions in seconds, especially for leveraged traders. Keeping a diversified portfolio, setting stop-loss orders and only investing what you can afford to lose are simple but effective ways to reduce risk during sudden market drops.
