BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has been named the best new ETF product by etf.com, as it recorded its highest inflows since Jan. 21. 
On April 23, BlackRock’s iShare Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) was awarded the “Best New ETF” at the annual etf.com ETF awards. In an X post shortly after, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said it “feels right to me.”
“I’m pretty sure this is how I voted. Both of them did things no one has seen [before],” Balchunas said, also referencing the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) winning the “ETF of the Year” award. Over the past 5 years, VOO is up 89%, according to Google Finance data.
IBIT was also the recipient of the Crypto ETP of the year. 
IBIT’s two awards came on the same day IBIT recorded $643.2 million in inflows, according to Farside data. It was the highest inflow day since Jan. 21, when it saw $661.9 million, just a day after US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, when Bitcoin’s spot price hit an all-time high of $109,000.
Bitcoin commentator Vivek said this “is massive,” while Apollo Sats co-founder Thomas Fahrer said, “Huge inflow.”
The IBIT fund, which launched in January 2024 alongside 10 other US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, has net assets of approximately $53.77 billion, according to BlackRock data. Over the past 30 days, it has traded, on average, 45.02 million shares per day. 
At the time of publication, a single IBIT share is trading at $53.20, as per Google Finance data.
Meanwhile, VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) received the award for “Best new ETF ticker.”

IBIT’s large inflow on April 23 made up most of the $917 million seen across all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs that day. It was the second day in a row with over $900 million in inflows amid most of the month posting outflow days due to macro uncertainty.
On April 23, Glassnode pointed out that the $912 million ETF inflows the day prior equaled more than 500 times the 2025 daily average.

d41ecfac92bee56918e9d4ba54a30d36,Cointelegraph,"Russia’s central bank, finance ministry to launch crypto exchange",https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-ministry-finance-central-bank-launch-crypto-exchange," Russia’s central bank announced a proposal in March to allow a limited number of Russian investors with a certain amount of assets to buy and sell cryptocurrencies under a three-year experimental regime. 
Russia’s finance ministry and central bank are reportedly planning to launch a crypto exchange for qualified investors under an experimental legal regime.
The platform will be aimed at “super-qualified investors,” Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said during a ministry meeting, according to April 23 reports from Russian media group RBC and Russian news agency Interfax.
“Together with the central bank, we will launch a crypto exchange for super-qualified investors. Crypto assets will be legalized, and crypto operations will be brought out of the shadows,” he said in a statement translated from Russian.
“Naturally, this will not happen domestically, but as part of the operations permitted under the experimental legal regime.”
The Russian central bank announced a proposal on March 12 to allow a limited number of Russian investors with a certain amount of assets to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) under a three-year experimental regime.
Under the proposal, the bank created a new investor category, super-qualified investors, defined by wealth and income thresholds of over 100 million rubles ($1.2 million) or a yearly income of at least 50 million rubles ($602,000).
The deputy director of the Finance Ministry’s financial policy department, Osman Kabaloev, said the criteria for a super-qualified investor are not yet final because they were floated in the early stages of discussions last year, according to RBC.
“Perhaps it will be in this format, or these indicators will be somehow adjusted in one direction or another - this is possible, I think there will be a wide range of discussions,” Kabaloev said in a statement translated from Russian.
Russia implemented a ban on using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for payments under its first crypto law, which came into force in January 2021.
However, the country has since been trying to make other crypto inroads. On April 16, Kabaloev said the Kremlin should be creating its own stablecoin after a recent freeze on wallets linked to the sanctioned Russian exchange Garantex by US authorities and stablecoin issuer Tether.

Meanwhile, Evgeny Masharov, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, proposed on March 20 to create a Russian government crypto fund that would include assets confiscated from criminal proceedings.
At the same time, other officials were progressing with new legislation on recognizing crypto as property for the purposes of criminal procedure legislation.

e64e266917e85ebf0d15a5c8efd9d83d,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin is the ‘cleanest shirt in the dirty laundry’ — Bitfinex,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-strength-us-stocks-equities-uncertainty-bitfinex-crypto-analysts," Bitcoin is up 7.68% over the past 30 days, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are down 6.79% and 8.14% respectively. 
Bitcoin has shown resilience compared to the broader financial market amid macroeconomic uncertainty, but analysts caution it’s still too early to know whether the trend will last.
“We’re not quite there yet, but if Bitcoin holds strength through the upcoming CPI, as well as ongoing Powell-related and equity earnings volatility, the decoupling narrative could evolve from “temporary divergence” to “regime change,” Bitfinex analysts said in an April 23 markets note viewed by Cointelegraph.
The analysts said that while Bitcoin’s (BTC) relative strength against US equities “appears real,” it is yet to be confirmed as structural. The analysts warned that Bitcoin has previously seen short periods of outperformance, only to eventually fall back in line with the broader market.
Cointelegraph recently reported that Bitcoin is increasingly abandoning its stock correlation to copy gold’s upside. At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s price has posted gains of 7.68% over the past 30 days. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are down 6.79% and 8.14%, respectively, as per Google Finance data.
Over the same period, Nvidia (NVDA), which has outperformed Bitcoin over the past decade, fell 15.4%. The analysts attributed the decline to the “effective ban on advanced chip exports to China and tariff-driven volatility.” In May 2024, Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said there is a “near zero chance of Nvidia outperforming Bitcoin over the next 10 years.”
The Bitfinex analysts described the current crypto market as a “hybrid state,” with rising macroeconomic risk on one side and an uptick in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows on the other. 
April 22 alone saw $913 million in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, the largest since late January.
They added that this reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a strong store of value, with Bitcoin dominance rising to levels not seen since late 2021. 
At the time of publication, Bitcoin's dominance was 64.39%, according to TradingView data.

Crypto market participants will be closely watching April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI), published on May 13, after March data showed a cooling trend that some saw as a short-term bearish signal for Bitcoin.
March’s CPI came in at 2.4% year-over-year, down from 2.8% in February, the lowest level since February 2023, according to the US Bureau of Statistics.
Meanwhile, some crypto analysts caution that other indicators suggest Bitcoin’s rally may not last.
10x Research head of research Markus Thielen said, “Given that our stablecoin minting indicator has yet to return to high-activity levels, we remain cautious about the sustainability of the current Bitcoin rally.”

The Los Angeles Police Department has recovered $2.7 million worth of Bitcoin mining machines it alleges were stolen by a crime ring in a heist at the city’s airport.
The LAPD said on April 22 that detectives from its Cargo Theft Unit, along with the city’s Port Police, the railroad-based Union Pacific Police, and the city’s Airport Police, arrested Oscar David Borrero-Manchola and Yonaiker Rafael Martinez-Ramos over the thefts.
Authorities claimed the pair are “prominent members” of a South American crime ring tied to the theft and sale of stolen goods in and around Los Angeles.
The LAPD said searches of storage unit facilities in the San Fernando Valley, northeast of downtown Los Angeles, recovered $4 million worth of stolen goods, including the Bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs taken from Los Angeles International Airport “as the shipment was about to be loaded onto a plane headed to Hong Kong.”
Detectives also found and seized over $1.2 million in allegedly stolen tequila, clothing, shoes, speakers, coffee, body wash, and pet food.
Borrero-Manchola and Martinez-Ramos were booked at Van Nuys Jail in the city’s northwest. Borrero-Manchola was cited for receiving stolen property and was released, while Martinez-Ramos was arrested on a no-bail warrant.
The LAPD said that “the investigation remains ongoing, and additional arrests may follow.”
The LAPD didn’t share the number of machines it seized or what model the rigs are, but a typical, current-model Bitcoin mining machine sells for between $3,000 to over $5,000.

US law enforcement has recovered stolen crypto mining rigs in the past. In July, the LAPD said it arrested a man it alleged was in possession of stolen Bitcoin mining rigs worth $579,000, seizing them from a cargo van and storage unit.
One of the largest thefts of Bitcoin mining rigs happened in late 2017 and early 2018 in Iceland, where a group robbed data centers to make off with over 600 machines.
The rigs reportedly ended up in China, as just three months after they were stolen, Chinese authorities seized a similar number and model of mining rigs in Tianjin, a city southeast of the capital, Beijing.

96a904b8c8782e8fbd9c56c949ede07f,Cointelegraph,Strike’s Mallers to head firm seeking superior Bitcoin play to MSTR,https://cointelegraph.com/news/twenty-one-capital-bitcoin-firm-compete-michael-saylor-strategy," Twenty One Capital has grand plans to dethrone Michael Saylor’s Strategy as the leading Bitcoin treasury firm, receiving investment support from industry heavyweights. 
Twenty One Capital, a new Bitcoin treasury company led by Strike founder Jack Mallers with the support of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald, is looking to supplant Michael Saylor’s Strategy to become the “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.”
Twenty One revealed it plans to launch with 42,000 Bitcoin (BTC) (worth $3.9 billion) with roughly 23,950 BTC coming from Tether, 10,500 BTC from Softbank and 7,000 BTC from Bitfinex, which will be converted into equity at $10 per share, according to an April 23 statement.
The firm is seeking a public listing via a blank-check merger with Cantor Equity Partners and will trade under the ticker XXI on the Nasdaq once it finalizes an agreement with investors to raise $585 million through convertible bonds and equity financing.
“Our mission is simple: to become the most successful company in Bitcoin, the most valuable financial opportunity of our time. We’re not here to beat the market, we’re here to build a new one,” said Mallers, the founder and CEO of Bitcoin payments-focused firm Strike.
Twenty One specifically compared its business model to Strategy’s in an investor presentation to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, claiming it is potentially a “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.”
It claimed that Strategy’s ability to create shareholder value through future Bitcoin purchases will be limited because the firm — which holds 534,741 BTC — would need to make even larger investments to increase its Bitcoin Per Share, or BPS, thus diminishing the per-share dollar impact of future capital deployments.
Twenty One said it would be a more “pure play” for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure with Bitcoin-native operations and more “flexibility” for strategic capital raises. 
A launch of 42,000 Bitcoin would make Twenty One the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only Strategy and Bitcoin mining firm  MARA Holdings, which holds 47,600 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data.
Twenty One also intends to build out several Bitcoin-focused offerings, including Bitcoin debt and equity products, an advisory service, a lending platform and an educational platform.
“Twenty One’s mission will be to accelerate Bitcoin adoption and Bitcoin literacy at both institutional and retail levels,” the firm said.

The firm will also partner with industry players to host Bitcoin conferences.
The news sparked a massive 54.2% price rally in Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) shares to $16.50 on April 23 and has risen another 25.1% in after-hours, Google Finance data shows. CEP will convert to XXI once the $585 million agreement is completed.
The venture strengthens Tether’s ties with Cantor, which manages US Treasury reserves backing Tether’s USDT, which boasts a market cap of $145.3 billion. Cantor also owns a 5% stake in the stablecoin issuer.
Twenty One will be majority-owned by Tether and crypto exchange Bitfinex, while Japanese investment holding firm SoftBank will own a “significant” minority share.

Sovereign wealth funds and other institutions were accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) during April 2025, while retail traders were exiting the markets via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and spot markets, according to John D’Agostino, the head of strategy at Coinbase Institutional.
During a recent appearance on CNBC, the Coinbase executive likened Bitcoin to gold and said that many institutional buyers bought BTC as a hedge against currency inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Coinbase executive said:
""When you do the work, there's a very short list of assets that mirror the characteristics of gold. Bitcoin is on that shortlist,"" the executive added.
Governments and financial institutions are increasingly adopting Bitcoin to protect purchasing power and the value of their treasuries in the face of macroeconomic shocks and geopolitical tensions.

Sovereign countries like El Salvador and Bhutan have adopted national Bitcoin reserves and actively purchase Bitcoin for their reserves.
Municipalities and state governments have also adopted pro-Bitcoin policies and proposed legislation to accumulate Bitcoin to protect the purchasing power of treasuries from depreciating fiat currencies.
Michael Saylor and Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, popularized the corporate Bitcoin treasury concept now adopted by a growing list of companies, including MARA, MetaPlanet, and Semler Scientific.
The executive also transformed the business software and intelligence company into a Bitcoin holding firm, akin to a BTC hedge fund.
On April 20, Saylor announced that over 13,000 institutions have direct exposure to Strategy, while an estimated 55 million beneficiaries have indirect financial exposure to the company.
Bitcoin recently surpassed Google in market capitalization, making Bitcoin one of the top five assets in the world, ranking above Amazon and Silver and showcasing the supply-capped digital asset's meteoric growth since 2009.

cc3ac4ae692e405be0b542d4ef8db427,Cointelegraph,"Traders pour into leveraged ETFs, gold in bid to weather volatility — Bloomberg",https://cointelegraph.com/news/traders-into-leveraged-etfs-gold-volatility-bloomberg," US spot Bitcoin ETFs clocked nearly $1 billion in inflows on April 22 despite turbulent markets. 
Traders are embracing diametrically opposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) strategies in a bid to navigate one of the most unpredictable financial markets in recent history, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence. 
The year-to-date has seen record inflows to ETFs providing leveraged long exposure to volatile assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, as well as funds holding risk-off assets such as cash and gold, the data shows. 
“[T]here's basically record flows going into leveraged long ETFs but also cash and gold ETFs as people buy the dip and hedge the dip at the same time. May the best degen win!,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said in an April 23 post on the X platform.
Leveraged ETFs are funds that aim to multiply the daily performance of assets like stocks or crypto, often by two or three times.
In 2025, leveraged long ETFs attracted net inflows of roughly $6 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Meanwhile, inflows into cash and gold funds approached roughly $4 billion. 
The record fund flows come amid a spike in market turbulence after US President Donald Trump announced plans for sweeping tariffs on US imports on April 2.
Since then, the S&P 500, an index of large US stocks, has shed roughly 5% of its value, according to data from Google Finance. Bitcoin (BTC), meanwhile, has been comparatively resilient. 
On April 22, the cryptocurrency’s spot price reclaimed $90,000 per coin for the first time in six weeks, with Bitcoin ETFs clocking nearly $1 billion in net inflows. The cryptocurrency trades above $93,000 as of April 23, according to data from Google Finance. 
“Even in the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, said in an April research report.  
Bitcoin has often been referred to as “digital gold” but the cryptocurrency still has a weak correlation to the safe haven asset and trades more in line with equities, Binance said. Its correlation with gold has averaged around 0.12 over the past 90 days, versus 0.32 for equities.  
“The key question is whether BTC can return to its long-term pattern of low correlation with equities,” noted the report, adding that gold is still a preferred safe-haven asset for most investors.
Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchanges are profiting off of rising volatility by doubling down on financial derivatives, such as futures. 
In April, net open interest in Bitcoin futures increased by upward of 30%, to approximately $28 billion, according to data from Coinalyze.

Key Takeaways:
Bitcoin short-term holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $100,000.
Long-term holders added 363,000 BTC since February, with new buyers injecting capital in April.
Bitcoin sell pressure risk exists at $97,000, where 392,000 BTC could be sold. 
Bitcoin’s (BTC) surge above $91,700 on April 22 pushed its value above the short-term realized price or cost basis. This implies that a majority of short-term holders (STHs) are currently back in profit.
STHs returning to profit after unrealized losses signal a bullish outlook, paving the way for a potential $100,000 retest.
Historically, during the early phase of a rally, STHs in profit provided upward momentum by holding firm and drawing in new investors. Bitcoin’s supply mapping indicated “strong activity” in April from first-time buyers, indicating fresh capital injections in the market at higher prices. 
Long-term holders (those holding for more than 155 days) increased their allocation by 363,000 BTC since February, while Bitcoin whales and sharks have absorbed 300% of the yearly issuance. 
Despite this week’s price breakout, Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. noted that the last strong resistance remains at $96,100. In an X post, the analyst said, 
Related: Why is Bitcoin price up today?
According to Bitcoin’s cost basis distribution data, investors hold approximately 392,000 BTC at an average cost basis of $97,000, creating a potential resistance zone. This concentration suggests many investors may sell at break-even, potentially stalling Bitcoin’s upward momentum.
However, anonymous trader Ezy Bitcoin emphasized Bitcoin's price action in the Wyckoff reaccumulation phase is “playing out beautifully”. The chart indicated continued strength, with three price targets: $131,500 (target 1), $144,900 (target 2), and $166,700 (target 3). 
This Wyckoff pattern points to possible accumulation by large players, signaling an upward trend for Bitcoin, as the market absorbs supply and prepares for an uptrend.

Which altcoins could follow? 
Key points:
Bitcoin’s rally is backed by solid institutional buying in the spot BTC ETFs.
A rally above the $95,000 level could be difficult, but analysts’ end-of-year price projections now extend to $200,000.
Select altcoins are showing signs of a price bottom.
Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied close to the $95,000 resistance level on April 23 as the cryptocurrency finds support from rising spot BTC ETF inflows and positive macroeconomic news in the United States. According to Farside Investors, the funds recorded net inflows of $381.3 million on April 21 and $912.7 million on April 22.
Analysts from Standard Chartered and Intellectia AI said that institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs and BTC’s use as a hedge against macroeconomic risk could propel the price to $200,000 in 2025.
Not everyone is convinced about the current rally. 10x Research head of research Markus Thielen questioned the sustainability of the Bitcoin rally in an April 23 markets report, as the stablecoin minting indicator was “yet to return to high-activity levels.”
Could Bitcoin break above the $95,000 mark, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
Bitcoin formed a Doji candlestick pattern on April 23, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears near the $95,000 overhead resistance.
The 20-day exponential moving average ($85,773) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the overbought zone, suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers do not cede much ground to the bears, it enhances the prospects of a rally above $95,000. The BTC/USDT pair may then skyrocket to $100,000 and subsequently to $107,000.
This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down sharply from $95,000 and plunges below the moving averages. 
Ether (ETH) turned up sharply on April 22 and rose above the 20-day EMA ($1,676). Buyers will try to retain the advantage by pushing the price above the 50-day SMA ($1,830) on April 23.
If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could jump to the breakdown level of $2,111. Sellers will try to stall the recovery at $2,111, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could soar to $2,550. Such a move suggests that the corrective phase may be over.
Conversely, if the price turns down sharply from $2,111, it indicates that the bears are active at higher levels. That could keep the pair range-bound between $2,111 and $1,368 for a while longer.
XRP (XRP) rose above the 50-day SMA ($2.20), but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels.
The bears are expected to defend the resistance line with all their might because a break and close above it signals a potential trend change. The XRP/USDT pair could then attempt a rally to $3.
On the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it signals that bears remain in command. The pair may then retest the $2 support, which is likely to attract buyers.
BNB (BNB) broke out of the downtrend line on April 21, but higher levels are attracting solid selling by the bears.
The BNB/USDT pair could drop to the moving averages, an important near-term support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the moving averages with strength, the prospects of a rally to $644 and thereafter to $680 increase. 
Alternatively, a break and close below the moving averages indicates that the breakout above the downtrend line may have been a bull trap. The pair then risks falling to $566.
Solana (SOL) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($133) on April 22 and is attempting to climb above the overhead resistance at $153 on April 23.
The 20-day EMA is sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating an advantage to buyers. A close above $153 clears the path for a rally to $180. Such a move brings the large $110 to $260 range into play.
Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly pull the price below the moving averages. If they do that, the SOL/USDT pair could plunge to the $120 to $110 support zone.
Dogecoin (DOGE) broke above the moving averages on April 22, indicating that the bulls are on a comeback.
The price could rally to the overhead resistance at $0.21, where the bears are expected to step in. If the price turns down from $0.21 and breaks below the moving averages, it signals a range-bound action in the near term. The DOGE/USDT pair could swing between $0.21 and $0.14 for some time.
Contrarily, a break and close above $0.21 completes a double-bottom pattern. The pair could then rally toward its target objective of $0.28.
Buyers pushed Cardano (ADA) above the 20-day EMA ($0.64) on April 22 and are trying to sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.68) on April 23.
The 20-day EMA is flattish, but the RSI has jumped into positive territory, indicating that the momentum has turned positive. A close above the 50-day SMA opens the gates for a rally to $0.83.
Buyers are expected to defend the zone between the 20-day EMA and $0.58 on the downside. Sellers will be back in the driver’s seat if they sink the ADA/USDT pair below $0.58. The pair may then slump to $0.50.
Related: Why is Bitcoin price up today?
Chainlink (LINK) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($13.16) and rose above the 50-day SMA ($13.62) on April 22.
The LINK/USDT pair could rise to $16, where the bears may mount a strong defense. If buyers do not allow the price to dip back below the 20-day EMA, it improves the prospects of a rally to the resistance line of the descending channel pattern. A trend change will be signaled on a break above the channel.
The 20-day EMA is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A dive below the 20-day EMA opens the doors for a fall to $11.89 and later to the support line.
Avalanche (AVAX) broke out of the downtrend line on April 22, indicating that the bears are losing their grip.
The bears will try to halt the recovery at $23.50 because if they fail in their endeavor, the AVAX/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective of $31.73.
If the price turns down from $23.50, the bulls will try to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA ($19.72). A bounce off the 20-day EMA increases the likelihood of a break above $23.50. Contrarily, a break below the moving averages signals a range formation between $15.27 and $23.50.
Sui (SUI) soared above the moving averages on April 22 and the overhead resistance at $2.86 on April 23.
The long wick on the candlestick shows selling above $2.86, but if the bulls do not give up much ground, the possibility of a break above the overhead resistance increases. That could propel the SUI/USDT pair to $3.25 and then to $3.50.
The 20-day EMA ($2.29) is expected to act as strong support on any pullback. A break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests the bullish momentum has weakened. That could result in a range formation in the near term.

934555077f8cafbceb4e5f36bd81f71c,Cointelegraph,"Bretton Woods institutions must reorient, US Treasury secretary says",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bessent-calls-bretton-woods-institutions-reorient," Scott Bessent said institutions such as the IMF and World Bank must correct trade imbalances and protect the value of fiat currencies against exchange rate risks. 
United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently called for “Bretton Woods institutions,” such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to reorient themselves, a signal that the global monetary order could be shifting.
Speaking at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) on April 23, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to correct trade imbalances and protect the value of fiat currencies against exchange rate risk.
""The Bretton Woods institutions must step back from their sprawling and unfocused agendas,"" Bessent said. He added:
Bessent's call for the IMF to correct trade imbalances between countries, specifically the US and China, coincides with a decline in the US dollar to three-year lows, $36 trillion in US government debt, and stiff economic competition from China.
Investor and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio argues that the world is experiencing a global macroeconomic shift that will upend the post-WWII financial order and eventually replace the US dollar as the global reserve currency, potentially with a digital form of money.

The Bretton Woods Agreement was signed in 1944 and pegged the currencies of 44 countries to the value of the US dollar, which, at that point, was pegged to the value of gold at $35 per ounce.
Eliminating complex foreign exchange risks between freely floating currencies to make global trade more efficient was the primary goal of the agreement.
In August 1971, US President Richard Nixon announced the end of the dollar's convertibility to gold — formally ending the Bretton Woods agreement in a move that was supposed to be temporary.
“Your dollar will be worth just as much tomorrow as it does today,” Nixon incorrectly told Americans during his now-infamous address.
The IMF and the World Bank, which were spawned from the Bretton Woods agreement, continue operating in an attempt to curb the effects of free-floating fiat currencies on the foreign exchange market.
Speaking at the White House Digital Asset Summit on March 7, Bessent said stablecoins could drive international demand for US dollars and US government debt instruments.
Bessent added that the Trump administration will use stablecoins to protect the US dollar and its status as the global reserve currency.
Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser argued against this plan, predicting that gold-backed stablecoins would outcompete dollar-pegged tokens due to the desire for low-volatility, inflation-resistant money.
In March this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote that the $36 trillion US national debt could drive investors to Bitcoin (BTC) as market participants start to see BTC as a better store of value than the US dollar.
Bitwise executive Jeff Park voiced a similar prediction in February, focused on the effects of US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs.
The analyst wrote that the tumult from the ongoing trade war would cause worldwide inflation, which would cause individuals to seek alternative stores of value like Bitcoin, driving its price much higher in the long term.

b2e86ead374aa36828498796cee2b07f,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin rebounds as bulls eye $100K and bears scramble to cover short positions,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rallies-as-bulls-eye-100-k-and-bears-rush-to-cover-shorts," Bitcoin bears are at risk of deep losses as soaring inflows to the spot BTC ETFs highlight the return of institutional investor demand. 
Key takeaways: 
Bearish Bitcoin traders were caught off guard by BTC’s rally above $90,000.
Spot volumes are driving the Bitcoin price rally.
Derivatives positions with a bearish bias remain at risk of liquidation.
Bitcoin (BTC) held above the $93,000 mark on April 24, suggesting a potential conclusion to the 52-day bear market that bottomed at $74,400. Although Bitcoin is beginning to show signs of decoupling from the stock market, professional traders have not altered their strategies, as indicated by BTC futures and margin market data.
A higher long-to-short ratio reflects a preference for long (buy) positions, while a lower ratio indicates a tilt toward short (sell) contracts. Currently, the top traders’ long-to-short ratio on Binance stands at 1.5x, a notable decrease from the 2x level observed ten days earlier. At OKX, the ratio peaked near 1.1x on April 17 but has since lost momentum and now sits at 0.9x.
Bitcoin’s 10% rally between April 20 and April 24 coincided with a more conciliatory stance from US President Donald Trump regarding import tariffs and his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who has faced scrutiny for maintaining high interest rates. On April 24, Trump stated he had “no intention” of firing Powell, marking a notable shift from his previous rhetoric.
Amid economic uncertainty, Deutsche Bank strategists have reduced their year-end S&P 500 target by 12% to 6,150. Meanwhile, the US dollar has weakened against other major currencies, pushing the DXY index below 99 for the first time in three years. Despite a modest 6% gain over the past 30 days, Bitcoin’s performance has secured it a place among the world’s top eight tradable assets, with a market capitalization of $1.84 trillion.
The sharp move above $90,000 caught Bitcoin bears off guard, resulting in over $390 million in leveraged short (sell) futures liquidations between April 21 and April 22. More significantly, aggregate open interest in BTC futures remains just 5% below its all-time high, indicating that bearish traders have not fully exited their positions.
If Bitcoin’s price maintains its upward momentum and breaks above $95,000, an additional $700 million in short (sell) futures positions could be liquidated, according to CoinGlass data. This potential short squeeze may prove especially challenging for bears, given the robust inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which totaled over $2.2 billion between April 21 and April 23.
A newly announced joint venture involving SoftBank, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Tether aims to accumulate Bitcoin through convertible bonds and equity financing, which could further strengthen the bullish case. Named “Twenty One Capital,” the Bitcoin treasury company is led by Strike founder Jack Mallers and plans to launch with 42,000 BTC.

The muted response from top traders in BTC margin and futures markets suggests that the recent buying pressure has originated mainly from spot markets, which is generally considered a positive indicator for a sustainable bull run.
The longer Bitcoin consolidates above $90,000, the greater the pressure on bears to cover their shorts, as this level reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is decoupling from the stock market. This could provide the confidence needed to challenge the $100,000 psychological threshold.

a1d34ef0840cbb053f3c7d3771b0bcb1,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin supply on exchanges is falling ‘due to public company purchases’ — Fidelity,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-supply-exchanges-falling-public-company-purchases-fidelity," BTC reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have fallen to the lowest level since November 2018. 
Bitcoin reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have dropped to their lowest level in more than six years, as publicly traded companies ramp up their accumulation of the digital asset following the US presidential election, according to Fidelity Digital Assets. 
“We have seen Bitcoin supply on exchanges dropping due to public company purchases — something we anticipate accelerating in the near future,” Fidelity reported on the X social media platform.
Fidelity said the supply of Bitcoin (BTC) on exchanges had fallen to roughly 2.6 million BTC, the lowest since November 2018. More than 425,000 BTC have moved off exchanges since November, a trend often viewed as a signal of long-term investment rather than short-term trading.
Over the same period, publicly-traded companies acquired nearly 350,000 BTC, Fidelity said.
Fidelity Digital Assets is a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, the $5.8 trillion asset manager headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The Fidelity Digital subsidiary was established in 2018, long before cryptocurrency was considered an institutional asset class. 
Fidelity is the issuer of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, one of the first 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved in the United States.

While Fidelity noted significant corporate Bitcoin purchases, most of the accumulation has been driven by Strategy, the business intelligence firm-turned-Bitcoin bank co-founded by Michael Saylor.
Since November, Strategy has acquired 285,980 BTC, accounting for 81% of the approximately 350,000 BTC purchased by publicly traded companies.
Strategy’s latest purchase of 6,556 BTC was disclosed on April 21. 
Outside the United States, publicly traded companies in Asia have adopted a similar Bitcoin treasury strategy, with Japan’s Metaplanet and Hong Kong’s HK Asia Holdings increasing their Bitcoin allocations. 
Metaplanet currently holds 5,000 BTC, with CEO Simon Gerovich saying his goal is to double that amount this year.
Meanwhile, HK Asia Holdings announced plans to raise roughly $8.35 million to potentially increase its Bitcoin reserves.

b208085932c4715f39885a1547edc622,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin 'short squeeze' or $87K dip next? BTC price predictions vary,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-short-squeeze-87k-dip-btc-price-predictions-vary," Bitcoin could liquidate a large block of leveraged shorts with a trip above its yearly open, but BTC price dip expectations are building as traders eye $87,000. 
Bitcoin is setting up a showdown with leveraged shorts immediately above its yearly open price.
That key level near $93,500 is the main target for traders hoping that BTC/USD will cement its latest breakout.
The next support retest could involve $87,000, analysis suggests.
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated below a key resistance target on April 24 as a BTC price forecast brought sub-$90,000 levels into play.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD retesting $92,000 as support overnight.
The pair broadly maintained six-week highs while global markets remained at a loss over the trajectory of the ongoing US trade war.
“The market is now up over +1% on the day on no news at all,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter summarized alongside a chart of the S&P 500 in part of its latest analysis on X.
Bitcoin continued to brush off news events, leaving volatility to equities, while gold attempted to stabilize after slipping from record highs earlier in the week.
“Fairly normal to have a slight correction here on Bitcoin as it's just had a massive breakout,” crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe told X followers on the day.
Others increasingly entertained the idea of a deeper correction following brisk gains for BTC/USD, potentially taking the market back below the $90,000 mark.
“A dip to 88k would be lovely,” popular trader Inmortal argued. 
A dip to 88k would be lovely.If the market gives it, I will probably play one of these two setups, or both.$BTC pic.twitter.com/ysqiheds7X
Trader and analyst Rekt Capital had a similar conception of the potential support retest move.
BTC price action, he observed, was closely copying behavior from the middle of its previous bull market in 2021.
“Part of Bitcoin continuing to repeat mid-2021 price tendencies relative to the Bull Market EMAs would be a dip into the $87000 (green EMA) level for a post-breakout retest, if at all needed,” he commented on a weekly chart showing two exponential moving averages (EMAs).
The main target for bulls thus remained the yearly open level just above $93,000, one which remained intact as resistance at the time of writing.

This coincided with a block of potential liquidation levels on exchange order books, providing fertile conditions for a “short squeeze” should price attack them.

The latest data from monitoring resource CoinGlass showed the largest concentration of liquidation leverage centered around $93,600.

db2bd407cb66185cf1ad8c71ce31c1da,Cointelegraph,The hidden risk of updatable firmware,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-hidden-risk-of-updatable-firmware," Crypto’s hidden threat: firmware updates in hardware wallets can be ticking time bombs, introducing vulnerabilities and backdoors. 
Opinion by: Igor Zemtsov, chief technology officer at TBCC
Crypto security is a ticking time bomb. Updatable firmware might just be the match that lights the fuse.
Hardware wallets have become the holy grail of self-custody, the ultimate safeguard against hackers, scammers and even government overreach. There’s an inconvenient truth, however, that most people ignore: Firmware updates aren’t just security patches. 
They’re potential backdoors, waiting for someone — whether a hacker, a rogue developer or a shady third party — to kick them wide open.
Every time a hardware wallet manufacturer pushes an update, users are forced to make a choice. Hit that update button and hope for the best, or refuse to update and risk using outdated software with unknown vulnerabilities. Either way, it’s a gamble. 
In crypto, a bad gamble can mean waking up to an empty wallet.
Updating firmware sounds like common sense. More security! Fewer bugs! Better user experience!
Here’s the thing: Every update is also an opportunity not just for the wallet provider but for anyone with the power, or motivation, to tamper with the process.
Hackers dream of firmware vulnerabilities. A rushed or poorly audited update can introduce tiny, almost imperceptible flaws — ones that sit in the background, waiting for the right moment to drain funds. And the best part? Users will never know what hit them.
Then there’s the more unsettling possibility: deliberate backdoors.
Recent: Hardware wallet Ledger helps competitor Trezor resolve security vulnerability
Tech companies have been forced to include government-mandated surveillance tools before. What makes anyone think hardware wallet makers are exempt? If a regulatory agency — or worse, a criminal organization — wants access to private keys, firmware updates are the perfect attack vector. One hidden function. One disguised line of code. 
That’s all it takes. Still think firmware updates are harmless? 
This isn’t some far-fetched, doomsday scenario. It has already happened.
Ledger, one of the biggest names in crypto security, had a major security crisis in 2018 when security researcher Saleem Rashid exposed a vulnerability that allowed attackers to replace Ledger Nano S firmware and hijack private keys. Nearly 1 million devices were at risk before a fix was rolled out. The scary part? There was no way for users to know if their devices had already been compromised.
In 2023, OneKey suffered a similar nightmare. White hat hackers demonstrated that its firmware could be cracked in mere seconds. No crypto was lost — this time. But what if real attackers had found the flaw first?
Then came the “Dark Skippy” exploit, taking firmware-based attacks to an entirely new level. With just two signed transactions, hackers could extract a user’s entire seed phrase — without setting off a single alarm. If firmware updates can be manipulated this easily, how can anyone be sure their assets are safe?
To be fair, not all firmware updates are security disasters. Ledger uses a proprietary operating system and secure element chips for added protection now. Trezor takes an open-source approach, allowing the community to scrutinize its firmware. Coldcard and BitBox02 give users manual control over updates, reducing — but not eliminating — risk.
Here’s the real question: Can users ever be 100% sure that an update won’t introduce a fatal flaw?
Some wallets have decided to eliminate the risk altogether. Tangem ships with fixed, non-updatable firmware, meaning that its code can never be altered once the device leaves the factory. No updates. No patches. 
Of course, this approach has its trade-offs. If a vulnerability is discovered, there’s no way to fix it. But in security, predictability matters. 
The crypto market was worth $2.79 trillion as of March 2025. With that much money on the table, cybercriminals, rogue insiders and overreaching governments are always looking for weak points. Hardware wallet makers should be laser-focused on security.
Choosing a hardware wallet shouldn’t feel like gambling with private keys. It shouldn’t involve blind trust in a corporation’s ability to push updates responsibly. Users deserve more than vague reassurances. They deserve security models that put control where it belongs — with them.
Security isn’t about convenience. It’s about control. Any system that requires trusting unknown developers, opaque update processes or firmware that can be changed at will? That’s not control. That’s a liability.
The only real way to keep a hardware wallet safe? Remove the guesswork. Strip away the blind trust. Always research the developers’ backgrounds, check their track record for security incidents, and see how they’ve handled past vulnerabilities. Stick to verifiable facts — security should never be based on assumptions.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

Bitcoin’s price trajectory may be suppressed ahead of its upcoming “omega candle” rally, according to Prince Filip Karađorđević, the hereditary prince of Serbia and Yugoslavia.
In an April 24 interview with Simply Bitcoin, Filip said some market participants may be limiting Bitcoin (BTC) price action.
“People are able to control the market to some extent,” he said. “Maybe that’s what acted on the 2021 market that suppressed its price from jumping high up. We could get that again in 2025, but there will be one point where [Bitcoin price] will run away.”
Filip added that Bitcoin remains a fundamentally deflationary asset and said its value is “always going to rise over time.”
He referenced the concept of the “omega candle,” made popular by Bitcoin advocate and Jan3 CEO Samson Mow. The theory predicts Bitcoin’s growth trajectory will explode after it hits the $100,000 mark.

“You’ll start to go up by 10,000 a day or drop by 10,000 a day. And this is the God candle. After that, we’ll start to see omega candles, which are 100,000 increments daily,” said Mow in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph in November 2024.
Factors contributing to Bitcoin’s growth include the growing distrust in the traditional financial system, according to Mow.

Bitcoin price saw an over 9% recovery over the past week as the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) accumulated over $2.2 billion worth of Bitcoin in the three days leading up to April 23, Farside Investors’ data shows.

Bitcoin may continue to see more upside if “equities continue higher during earnings week,” but the “still-elevated macro uncertainty could limit broad-based upside,” the analysts added.
Stock and cryptocurrency investors are also concerned about a potential recession in the US. JPMorgan estimates a 60% probability for a recession in 2025, citing US President Donald Trump’s 145% tariffs on China as a “material threat to growth” that increases the odds of an economic downturn.

What if paying with crypto was as easy and as fun as sending a meme on X?
In the latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, StarkWare’s Nathan Jeffay and Cointelegraph’s Gareth Jenkinson sit down with Stefana Banciu, growth lead at Pulsar Money, to explore how blockchain is bringing payments into the digital age, with speed, transparency and a dash of playfulness.
Banciu lays out how Pulsar is pushing the frontier of Web3 payments with features like social transfers that allow users to send crypto directly through X, simply by tagging a handle. 
The episode cuts through the crypto jargon to tackle a question with mainstream resonance: Why aren’t we using crypto for everyday transactions yet?
“I wish I could say yes, but that wouldn’t be a true reflection of the state of affairs,” Jenkinson admits when asked if crypto is widely used for payments. He points to Mastercard-linked crypto cards as a stopgap, but says the real revolution hasn’t yet reached the coffee shop counter.

For Banciu, the path forward lies in bridging fun and fundamentals. While crypto’s founding ideals include borderless, permissionless transfers and low fees, she says onboarding the next wave of users will require experiences that are intuitive, social and entertaining.
Their platform includes a “social payments module” that lets users send crypto directly through X by tagging a handle, a small but powerful step toward making transactions feel more like communication than banking.
“You can actually send funds directly on Twitter,” Banciu says.
But convenience alone isn’t enough. Banciu says making crypto fun is key to onboarding the next wave of users. 
“We all know within the crypto space, the whole community that is here for perhaps something else than payments, which is quite boring, right?” she adds. “So we said, OK, why not think of a way to onboard users, make them do payments in a fun way?”
For Jenkinson, making crypto usable as a true “medium of exchange” is essential to its legitimacy.

A bill that would allow New Hampshire to invest a portion of its state funds in digital assets and precious metals has advanced to a full Senate vote after passing a second committee.
On April 23, House Bill 302 (HB 302) was reviewed in the second Senate committee and passed in a 4-1 vote.
The legislation, introduced in January, cleared the New Hampshire House earlier this month in a 192–179 vote. It now faces a vote by the full Senate and, if approved, will require the governor’s signature to become law.
Once enacted, it would allow the New Hampshire treasury to use 10% of the state’s general funds to invest in crypto with a market cap of over $500 billion — a threshold currently met only by Bitcoin (BTC).
During a debate before the full House vote, Democratic Representative Terry Spahr argued that the bill is unnecessary. 
The lawmaker said it could undermine the future security of the state’s digital asset stockpile. Spahr argued that the state treasurer already has the authority to manage investments without the bill.
Others said that it could earn the state good returns for its investment. Republican Representative Jordan Ulery said the investments could net the state a “large amount of money.”

HB 639 addresses blockchain dispute resolution and regulatory frameworks, while HB 310 focuses on real-world asset tokenization and stablecoin usage.
New Hampshire’s progress comes as Arizona pursues a more aggressive approach by exploring the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, aiming to become the first US state to implement the policy.

Asian investment firms are stepping up their Bitcoin accumulation strategies, with Japan’s Metaplanet and Hong Kong’s HK Asia Holdings leading the way.
Tokyo-based Metaplanet disclosed on April 24 that it acquired an additional 145 Bitcoin (BTC) for 1.9 billion Japanese yen (around $13.4 million), boosting its total holdings to 5,000 BTC.
Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich confirmed the company had reached 50% of its initial goal of amassing 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025.
The firm has been aggressive in its Bitcoin treasury operations, using bond issuances and Bitcoin income strategies such as selling cash-secured BTC put options to finance its acquisitions.

HK Asia Holdings has also announced plans to raise about $65 million Hong Kong dollars ($8.35 million) by issuing new shares and convertible notes to potentially buy more BTC.
According to an April 23 filing, the company entered into share subscription and convertible note (CN) subscription agreements after trading hours.
The deal includes issuing 3,272,000 new shares at a subscription price of HK$4.01 per share, alongside convertible notes valued at HK$52.38 million in aggregate principal amount. The newly issued shares will represent about 0.82% of HK Asia Holdings’ total shares in circulation.
While the filing does not mention that HK Asia Holdings intends to use the funds to buy Bitcoin, many in the crypto community speculated that the capital raise is expected to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions.
The speculation follows HK Asia’s February decision to step into Bitcoin markets. After buying its first BTC on Feb. 16, the firm doubled its share price within a day.
By Feb. 20, HK Asia expanded its holdings by purchasing an additional 7.88 BTC, bringing its total to nearly 9 BTC at an average price of $97,021 per coin.
Shares in HK Asia were up by around 5.4% on April 24 at the Hong Kong stock market closing, according to Google Finance.

aa0dd8d87acf52650886bfff44f66cae,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin's next big resistance is $95K— What will trigger the breakout?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-next-big-resistance-is-95k-what-will-trigger-breakout," Decreasing Bitcoin exchange inflows, resurgent ETF demand and other bullish factors could push BTC price above the next big hurdle at $95,000. 
Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows are at their highest since January 2025.
Inflows to exchanges down to levels last seen in December 2016.
Bitcoin’s negative funding rates could set up a short squeeze.
BTC price is above major moving averages, which can now provide support.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose to a new range high at $94,700 on April 23, its highest value since March 2.
Several analysts said the next psychological resistance remains at $95,000, and the price might drop to test support levels below.
“The $94K–$95K zone is clearly the resistance to beat,” said Swissblock in an April 24 post on X. 
The onchain data provider asserted that the next logical move for Bitcoin would be a pullback toward the $90,000 zone to gain momentum for a move higher.
Popular Bitcoin analyst AlphaBTC opined that the asset will likely consolidate in the $93,000-$95,000 range “before pushing higher to take liquidity above 100K.”
Several bullish signs suggest that BTC is well-positioned to break above $95,000 in the following days or weeks.
One factor supporting the Bitcoin bull argument is resurgent institutional demand, reflected by significant inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
On April 22 and April 23, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net flow totaling $936 million and $917 million, respectively, as per data from SoSoValue.
As Cointelegraph reported, these inflows have been the highest since January 2025 and more than 500 times the 2025 daily average.
This trend reflects growing confidence among traditional finance players, as observed by market analysts like Jamie Coutts, who noted global liquidity hitting new all-time highs, historically fueling asset price rallies. 
Institutional buying creates sustained upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price by absorbing the available supply.
The trend of decreasing Bitcoin exchange inflows continues, suggesting a potential reduction in sell pressure. 
The total amount of coins transferred to the exchanges has dropped from a year-to-date high of 97,940 BTC per day on Feb. 25 to 45,000 BTC on April 23, as per data from CryptoQuant. 
This is reinforced by a reduction in the number of addresses depositing Bitcoin to exchanges, which has been “steadily declining since 2022,” according to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. 
He highlights that this metric’s 30-day moving average has dropped to 52,000 BTC, a level last seen in December 2016. 
“This trend is bullish in itself,” as it represents a fourfold reduction in coin sales over the last three years, the analyst said, adding:
Bitcoin price has rebounded to levels last seen in early March, but futures trades are not entirely on board yet. 
Bitcoin’s perpetual futures funding rates remained negative between April 22 and April 23, despite the price rising by 11% over the same period, data from Glassnode shows.
Negative funding rates imply that shorts are paying longs, reflecting a bearish sentiment that can fuel a short squeeze as prices rise.

In an April 22 post on X, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost highlighted a similar divergence in Bitcoin’s price and Binance funding rates. 
“Whereas BTC continues to climb, funding rates on Binance have turned negative, currently sitting at around -0.006 at the time of writing,” Darkfost explained.
He added that this is a rare occurrence, which has historically been followed by significant rallies, like Bitcoin’s surge from $28,000 to $73,000 in October 2023, and from $57,000 to $108,000 in September 2024.
If history repeats itself, Bitcoin may rally from the current levels, breaking above the resistance at $95,000 toward $100,000.
On April 22, Bitcoin price rose above a key level: the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) currently at $88,690, fueling a marketwide recovery.
The last time the BTC price broke above the 200-day SMA, it experienced a parabolic move, rallying 80% from $66,000 on Oct. 14, 2024, to its previous all-time high of $108,000 on Dec. 17. 
This level should provide significant support as Bitcoin trades above this key trendline. But if it doesn’t hold, the following levels to watch will likely be $84,379, the 50-day SMA, and the $80,000 psychological level.
For the bulls, the resistance levels at $95,000 and $100,000 are the primary ones to watch. Rising above that would pave the way for a run toward the Jan. 20 all-time high above $109,000.
