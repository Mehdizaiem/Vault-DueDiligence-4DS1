4b6ceb348e8c48782b011cbcf718e0eb,Cointelegraph,First Trust launches Bitcoin strategy ETFs,https://cointelegraph.com/news/first-trust-launches-bitcoin-strategy-etfs," Exchange-traded funds offering structured exposure to Bitcoin's performance are becoming popular among traditional investors. 
First Trust Advisors has launched two Bitcoin (BTC) strategy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with Bitcoin exposure while capping losses and earning yield, the asset manager said. 
The move comes amid an outpouring of funds seeking to enhance Bitcoin’s appeal to traditional investors by offering tailored exposure to the cryptocurrency’s performance.
The FT Vest Bitcoin Strategy Floor15 ETF (BFAP) is designed to track Bitcoin’s performance up to a capped upside while limiting drawdown risk to approximately 15%, First Trust said in an announcement.
“Over the past few years, investors have shown a remarkably strong appetite for bitcoin-linked ETFs, but the potential for sharp drawdowns has kept many on the sidelines,” Ryan Issakainen, an ETF strategist at First Trust, said in a statement.

The FT Vest Bitcoin Strategy & Target Income ETF (DFII) is an actively managed fund aiming to offer partial Bitcoin exposure while generating a yield that beats short-dated US Treasurys by at least 15%, according to the asset manager. 
The DFII fund “will seek to take advantage of bitcoin’s high volatility to generate income by selling call options,” Issakainen said. The BFAP fund also uses financial derivatives to hedge downside risk. 
Options are contracts granting the right to buy or sell — “call” or “put,” in trader parlance — an underlying asset at a certain price.

Launched in January 2024, Bitcoin ETFs emerged as one of last year’s hottest investment products. 
As of April 4, spot BTC ETFs collectively manage approximately $93 billion in assets, according to data from Bitbo.

Other types of ETFs designed to offer tailored exposure to Bitcoin’s performance are also gaining popularity. 
On April 2, Grayscale — a cryptocurrency-focused asset manager — launched two Bitcoin strategy ETFs. Like First Trust’s ETFs, they use financial derivatives to optimize for downside risk management and income generation. 
In March, asset manager Bitwise launched an ETF holding stocks of companies with large Bitcoin treasuries. 
Spot BTC ETFs saw nearly $100 million in outflows on April 3 amid the heightened market volatility following US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement of sweeping tariffs on April 2.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has managed to stay above the $80,000 level as volatility wrecked US stock markets on April 3 and April 4. The failure of the bears to capitalize on the opportunity shows a lack of selling at lower levels.
Risky assets were rattled after US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on several countries on April 2. The fall in the US markets deepened on April 4 after China announced a retaliatory tariff of 34% on all imported US goods starting April 10.
While several market participants are concerned about the near-term impact of tariffs, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said he loves tariffs since he expects them to be positive for Bitcoin and gold in the medium term.

On the more cautious side was market commentator Byzantine General, who said in a post on X that the cryptocurrency market’s upside would be limited due to possible tariff responses. 
Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards said in his analysis that Bitcoin would turn bullish on a break and close above $91,000. If that does not happen, he anticipates Bitcoin to fall to the $71,000 zone.
Could Bitcoin outperform by staying above $80,000? Will the altcoins crumble? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
Bitcoin rose above the resistance line on April 2, but the long wick on the candlestick shows solid selling at higher levels. The price turned down sharply and broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($84,483).

The bears will have to sink the price below the $80,000 support to strengthen their position. If they do that, the BTC/USDT pair could retest the March 11 low of $76,606. Buyers are expected to defend this level with all their might because a break and close below $76,606 could sink the pair to $73,777 and eventually to $67,000.
The crucial resistance to watch out for on the upside is $88,500. A break and close above this level will signal that the corrective phase may be over. The pair could then start its journey toward $95,000.
Ether (ETH) has been trading between the $1,754 support and the 20-day EMA ($1,928) for the past few days.
ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
That increases the likelihood of a break and close below $1,754. If sellers can pull it off, the ETH/USDT pair could start the next leg of the downtrend to $1,550.
A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that the relative strength index (RSI) has formed a positive divergence. That suggests the bearish momentum may be weakening. If the price rebounds off $1,754, the pair could face selling at the 20-day EMA. However, if buyers overcome the obstacle, the pair could rally to $2,111. A short-term trend reversal will be signaled on a close above $2,111.
XRP (XRP) bears successfully defended the 20-day EMA ($2.23) on April 2 and pulled the price to the critical support at $2.
XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 44 increase the risk of a break below $2. If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. The pair has support at $1.77, but if the level gets taken out, the decline could extend to $1.27.
Buyers have an uphill task ahead of them if they want to prevent the breakdown. They will have to swiftly push the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($2.37) to clear the path for a relief rally to the resistance line.
BNB (BNB) bulls failed to push the price back above the moving averages in the past few days, indicating selling at higher levels.
BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The moving averages have started to turn down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling a minor advantage for the bears. There is support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $575 and next at the 61.8% retracement level of $559.
On the upside, the bulls will have to push and maintain the price above the 50-day SMA ($614) to signal a comeback. The BNB/USDT pair may rise to $644, which is a critical overhead resistance to watch out for. If buyers overcome the barrier at $644, the pair may travel to $686.
Solana (SOL) rose above the 20-day EMA ($128) on April 2, but the bears sold at higher levels and pulled the price below the $120 support.
SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory heighten the risk of a break below $110. If that happens, the selling could intensify, and the SOL/USDT pair may plummet to $100 and subsequently to $80.
The bulls are unlikely to give up easily and will try to keep the pair inside the $110 to $260 range. Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above $147 to suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair may then ascend to $180.
Dogecoin (DOGE) bears thwarted attempts by the bulls to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.17) on April 2.
DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
A positive sign in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to slide below the $0.16 support. A break above the 20-day EMA could push the price to the 50-day SMA ($0.19). Buyers will have to overcome the 50-day SMA to start a rally to $0.24 and later to $0.29.
Alternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages and breaks below $0.16, it will clear the path for a drop to $0.14. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $0.14 support because a break below it may sink the DOGE/USDT pair to $0.10.
Cardano (ADA) turned down sharply from the 20-day EMA ($0.69) on April 2 and closed below the uptrend line.
ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The bulls are trying to push the price back above the uptrend line but are likely to face solid selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the ADA/USDT pair could descend to $0.58 and then to $0.50.
This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up sharply and breaks above the 50-day SMA ($0.74). That opens the doors for a rally to $0.84, which may attract sellers.

The TON/USDT pair broke below the 20-day EMA ($3.65) on April 3, indicating that the bullish momentum is weakening. There is support at $3.32, but if the level cracks, the pair may drop to $2.81.
Instead, if the price rebounds off $3.32, the pair could attempt to form a range in the near term. The pair could swing between $3.32 and $4.14 for some time. A break and close above $4.14 will signal that the downtrend may be over. The pair could then jump to $5.
UNUS SED LEO (LEO) bears pulled the price below the uptrend line on March 2 but could not sustain the lower levels. That suggests buying at lower levels.
LEO/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The 20-day EMA ($9.57) is turning down gradually, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling a slight advantage to the bears. If the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the LEO/USD pair below the $8.84 support. If they succeed, the pair may tumble to $8.
Contrarily, a break above the moving averages opens the doors for a rise to the overhead resistance of $9.90. If buyers pierce the $9.90 resistance, the pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern. The pair may then climb toward the target objective of $12.04.
Chainlink (LINK) once again turned down from the 20-day EMA ($13.98) on March 2, indicating that the bears continue selling on rallies.
LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The LINK/USDT pair has strong support in the zone between $12 and the support line of the descending channel pattern. A rebound off the support zone will have to rise above the moving averages to signal a stronger recovery toward $17.50.
Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will attempt to pull the price below the support line. If they can pull it off, the pair could extend the downtrend toward the crucial support at $10 and, after that, to $8.

f0de0cdacd5e25b236da5250b55a799d,Cointelegraph,Crypto market bottom likely by June despite tariff fears: Finance Redefined,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-bottom-june-tariff-fears-finance-redefined," Nansen analysts expect a 70% probability that crypto markets will find their bottom by June, as tariff negotiations are pressuring traditional markets worldwide. 
Despite growing tariff-related uncertainty, there is a 70% probability cryptocurrency markets will find the local bottom in the next two months, which will serve as the supporting foundation for the next leg up in the 2025 cycle, according to Nansen analysts.
Savvy traders continue making generational wealth despite growing volatility and lack of risk appetite. One unidentified trader turned an initial $2,000 investment into over $43 million by trading the popular frog-themed memecoin, Pepe.
The cryptocurrency market may see a local bottom in the next two months amid global uncertainty over ongoing import tariff negotiations, which have been limiting investor sentiment in both traditional and digital markets.
US President Donald Trump on April 2 announced reciprocal import tariffs, measures aimed at reducing the country’s estimated trade deficit of $1.2 trillion in goods and boosting domestic manufacturing. 
While global markets took a hit from the first tariff announcement, there is a 70% chance for cryptocurrency valuations to find their bottom by June, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at the Nansen crypto intelligence platform.
The research analyst told Cointelegraph:
“Nansen data estimates a 70% probability that crypto prices will bottom between now and June, with BTC and ETH currently trading 15% and 22% below their year-to-date highs, respectively. Given this data, upcoming discussions will serve as crucial market indicators.”
She added: “Once the toughest part of the negotiation is behind us, we see a cleaner opportunity for crypto and risk assets to finally mark a bottom.”

A savvy cryptocurrency trader reportedly turned $2,000 into more than $43 million by investing in the memecoin Pepe at its peak valuation, despite the token’s extreme volatility and lack of underlying technical value.
The trader made an over 4,700-fold return on investment on the popular frog-themed Pepe (PEPE) cryptocurrency, according to blockchain intelligence platform Lookonchain.
“This OG spent only $2,184 to buy 1.5T $PEPE($43M at the peak) in the early stage. He sold 1.02T $PEPE for $6.66M, leaving 493B $PEPE($3.64M), with a total profit of $10.3M(4,718x), Lookonchain wrote in a March 29 X post.

The trader realized over $10 million in profit despite Pepe’s price falling over 74% from its all-time high of $0.00002825, reached on Dec. 9, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.

Memecoins are considered some of the most speculative and volatile digital assets, with price action driven largely by online enthusiasm and social sentiment rather than fundamental utility or innovation.
Still, they’ve proven capable of generating life-changing returns. In May 2024, another early Pepe investor turned $27 into $52 million — a 1.9 million-fold return — according to onchain data.

The global stablecoin supply may surge to $1 trillion by the end of 2025, potentially becoming a key catalyst for broader cryptocurrency market growth, according to David Pakman, managing partner at crypto-native investment firm CoinFund.
“We’re in a stablecoin adoption upswell that’s likely to increase dramatically this year,” Pakman said during Cointelegraph’s Chainreaction live show on X on March 27. “We could go from $225 billion stablecoins to $1 trillion just this calendar year.”
He noted that such growth, while modest compared to global financial markets, would represent a “meaningfully significant” shift for blockchain-based finance.
Pakman also suggested that the rise in capital flowing onchain, combined with growing interest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), could further support decentralized finance (DeFi) activity:
“If we have a moment this year where ETFs are permitted to provide staking rewards or yield to holders, that unlocks really meaningful uplift in DeFi activity, broadly defined.”

Avalanche saw a significant surge in stablecoin supply over the past year, but the onchain deployment of this capital points to passive investor behavior, which may be limiting demand for the network’s utility token.
The stablecoin supply on the Avalanche network rose by over 70% over the past year, from $1.5 billion in March 2024 to over $2.5 billion as of March 31, 2025, according to Avalanche’s X post.

Stablecoins are the main bridge between the fiat and crypto world, and increasing stablecoin supply is often seen as a signal for incoming buying pressure and growing investor appetite.
However, Avalanche’s (AVAX) token has been in a downtrend, dropping nearly 60% over the past year to trade just above $19 despite the $1 billion increase in stablecoin supply, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.

“The apparent contradiction between surging stablecoin value on Avalanche and AVAX's significant price decline likely stems from how that stablecoin liquidity is being held,” according to Juan Pellicer, senior research analyst at IntoTheBlock crypto intelligence platform.

Economic uncertainty and a major crypto exchange hack pushed down the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to $156 billion in the first quarter of 2025, but AI and social apps gained ground with an increase in network users, according to a crypto analytics firm.
“Broader economic uncertainty and lingering aftershocks from the Bybit exploit” were the main contributing factors to the DeFi sector’s 27% quarter-on-quarter fall in TVL, according to an April 3 report from DappRadar, which noted that the price of Ether (ETH) fell 45% to $1,820 over the same period.

The largest blockchain by TVL, Ethereum, fell 37% to $96 billion, while Sui was the hardest hit of the top 10 blockchains by TVL, falling 44% to $2 billion.
Solana, Tron and the Arbitrum blockchains also saw their TVLs slashed over 30%.
Meanwhile, blockchains that experienced a larger volume of DeFi withdrawals and had a smaller share of stablecoins locked in their protocols faced extra pressure on top of the falling token prices.
The newly launched Berachain was the only top-10 blockchain by TVL to rise, accumulating $5.17 billion between Feb. 6 and March 31, DappRadar noted.

Bitcoin (BTC) sits in one of its least bullish phases since January 2023. According to Bitcoin’s “bull score index,” investor sentiment is showing its lowest reading in two years.

CryptoQuant’s “Crypto Weekly Report” newsletter explained that “bull score index” readings that sit below 40 for extended periods increase the likelihood of a bear market. The bull score remained above 40 throughout 2024, only dipping below this threshold in February 2025, as identified in the chart above. 
However, over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price has displayed resilience when compared against the massive losses seen in the US stock market. On April 3, Bitcoin closed the day with a green candle, while the S&P 500 was down 4.5%, a historic first.  
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones extended their decline on April 4, dropping 3.87% and 3.44%, respectively, while Bitcoin held steady near the breakeven point.

Data from CryptoQuant indicates that Bitcoin’s Value Days Destroyed (VDD) metric currently sits around 0.72, suggesting that Bitcoin price is in a transitional phase. Since 2023, such periods have preceded either price consolidation or renewed accumulation before a bullish breakout.

The Bitcoin VDD metric tracks the movement of long-term held coins, and it has signaled a notable market trend since late 2024. The metric peaked at 2.27 on Dec. 12, signaling aggressive profit-taking and this dynamic matched the highs seen in 2021 and 2017. However, VDD dropped to 0.65 in April, reflecting a cooling-off period where profit-taking has subsided. 
This opens the possibility of a “risk-on” market for Bitcoin. In financial terms, a ""risk-on"" scenario occurs when investors embrace higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies, often driven by optimism and mean reversions in trends. 
Amid ongoing market uncertainty that has been fueled by the US-led trade war, Bitcoin could unexpectedly gain from these tense conditions. 
Speaking on Bitcoin and the crypto market’s potential as a hedge against traditional market volatility, crypto trader Jackis said, 
Similarly, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index also exhibited a “fear” category with a score of 28 on April 4. The index registered an ""extreme fear"" score of 25 on April 3, suggesting that the current price may present a compelling buying opportunity.

Analysts say Bitcoin (BTC) price could drop to $70,000 within the next ten days as one BTC pricing model suggests that the US-led trade war could upend investors’ risk-asset sentiment.
In his latest X analysis, network economist Timothy Peterson warned that Bitcoin may return to its 2021-era all-time high.
Bitcoin price expectations continue to deteriorate as the impact of “higher than expected” US trade tariffs hits home.
For Peterson, the outlook now includes an uncomfortable trip down memory lane.
“Bitcoin to $70k in 10 days?” he queried.
An accompanying chart compared Bitcoin bear markets and included Peterson’s Lowest Price Forward (LPF) metric — a historically accurate yardstick for gauging long-term BTC price bottoms.
“While this chart is not a prediction, it does provide data-driven expectations for what Bitcoin could do,” he continued.

Peterson noted that the theory ties in with current LPF data, which last month said that BTC/USD was 95% certain to preserve the 2021 highs as support. 
Prior to that, the metric successfully delivered a $10,000 price floor in mid-2020, with Bitcoin never again dropping below it after September that year.
Continuing, Peterson revealed probabilities for April which showed BTC price expectations in a state of flux.
“Bitcoin went from 75% chance of having a positive month to a 75% chance of having a negative month in just 2 days,” he summarized alongside another proprietary chart.

The bearish outlook of Peterson’s model is far from the only bearish warning coming to light this week.
As noted by onchain analytics firm Glassnode, many traders are attempting to shield themselves from further crypto market turmoil.
“Puts are trading at a premium to calls, signaling a spike in demand for downside protection. This skew is most pronounced in short-term maturities - a level of fear not seen since $BTC was in the $20Ks in mid-’23,” it revealed in an X thread on April 4.

Glassnode nonetheless acknowledged that while under pressure, current price performance does not constitute a post-tariff capitulation of the sort seen in stocks.
“Despite this, $BTC hasn't broken down like equities did on recent tariff headlines. That disconnect - rising panic without a price collapse - makes the current options market setup especially notable,” it continued.

f2f4dffe7a685c0746d0fbc491711f08,Cointelegraph,The future of DeFi isn’t on Ethereum — it’s on Bitcoin,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-future-of-defi-is-on-bitcoin," As Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem falters and Solana succumbs to speculation, Bitcoin quickly becomes the unlikely hero of decentralized finance. 
Opinion by: Matt Mudano, CEO of Arch Labs 
Ethereum is struggling, and decentralized finance (DeFi) is suffering as a result. Layer-2 (L2) solutions have fractured liquidity, making capital inefficient. In search of greener pastures, the community has turned to Solana — only to find a memecoin-driven ecosystem fueled by pump-and-dump schemes, attracting liquidity extractors, and turning the chain into a playground for speculation and fraud.
DeFi needs a reset that returns to first principles and aligns with Satoshi’s original vision of a decentralized financial system. The only network capable of sustaining the next evolution of DeFi isn’t Ethereum or Solana. It’s Bitcoin.
Ethereum was once the undisputed home of DeFi, but today, it’s clear that the ecosystem is struggling. The network’s roadmap constantly changes, with no clear path toward long-term sustainability.
L2 solutions were supposed to scale Ethereum. Instead, they’ve fractured DeFi into isolated liquidity silos. While L2s have lowered transaction fees, they now compete for liquidity rather than contributing to a unified financial system. The result? A fragmented landscape that makes capital inefficient and DeFi protocols harder to scale.
Ethereum’s proposed solution — chain abstraction — sounds promising in theory but fails in practice. The fundamental issue is a structural misalignment of incentives, and as a result, Ethereum is gradually losing its competitive edge in DeFi.
It’s time to ask: Can DeFi’s future lie in a fragmented Ethereum?
With Ethereum losing its competitive edge, many developers and users have turned to Solana. The blockchain has seen an 83% increase in developer activity year-over-year, and its decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have outperformed Ethereum’s for five consecutive months. 
There’s a fundamental problem: Solana’s DeFi growth isn’t built on sustainable financial applications — a memecoin frenzy fuels it.
The recent surge in activity isn’t driven by innovation in decentralized finance but by speculative trades. Following the TRUMP memecoin craze, the total extracted value from Solana’s memecoins ranged between $3.6 billion and $6.6 billion. This isn’t DeFi growth — it’s a liquidity extraction engine where short-term speculators cash in and move on.
Solana has real strengths. Its speed and low transaction costs make it ideal for high-frequency trading, and its ecosystem has made meaningful strides in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), AI and decentralized science, or DeSci. But the dominance of memecoin speculation has turned the chain into a playground for fraud and pump-and-dump schemes. That’s not the foundation DeFi needs.
Solana isn’t the answer if the goal is to build a lasting financial system.
It’s time to return to first principles and build DeFi on the original blockchain: Bitcoin — the most trusted, decentralized network backed by the soundest money in the digital economy.
This is not just theoretical. Bitcoin DeFi is already experiencing explosive growth. Consider the numbers: Total value locked (TVL) in Bitcoin DeFi surged from $300 million in early 2024 to $5.4 billion as of Feb. 28, 2025 — a staggering 1,700% increase. The Bitcoin staking sector is dominating, with protocols like Babylon ($4.68 billion TVL), Lombard ($1.59 billion) and SolvBTC ($715 million) leading the charge. This demonstrates the growing demand for Bitcoin to become a productive asset rather than a passive store of value.
Recent: Bitcoin DeFi takes center stage
Bitcoin-native DeFi isn’t simply copying Ethereum’s playbook — it’s pioneering new financial models. Advancements in the space have introduced dual staking, allowing users to stake Bitcoin (BTC) alongside native tokens to enhance security and earn yields. Meanwhile, novel approaches to tokenizing Bitcoin’s hashrate turn mining power into collateral for lending, borrowing and staking, further expanding Bitcoin’s financial utility.
In addition, Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens have driven record-high transaction activity, with inscriptions reaching 66.7 million and generating $420 million in fees — highlighting the growing demand for tokenized assets on Bitcoin.
It is clear that Bitcoin is no longer just digital gold — it’s becoming the foundation for the next phase of decentralized finance.
The future of DeFi lies with Bitcoin, where incentives align with long-term value creation. Unlike Ethereum’s fragmented model and Solana’s speculative economy, Bitcoin-based DeFi is built on institutional-grade liquidity and sustainable growth.
As the largest and most liquid crypto asset, Bitcoin boasts a $1.7 trillion market cap and $94 billion in exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings. Even a fraction of this liquidity migrating into DeFi would be a game-changer. Bitcoin holds over $1 trillion in untapped liquidity and continues to attract strong interest from institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds, with governments already exploring it as a potential reserve asset.
Several projects are already building on Bitcoin, building a sustainable ecosystem where users can hold the most trusted digital asset while making it productive through DeFi mechanisms. 
Ethereum had its moment. Solana had its hype. It’s Bitcoin’s turn to actualize Satoshi’s original vision of a decentralized financial system.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed erratic moves on Bitcoin’s lower timeframes as the daily high near $84,700 evaporated as BTC price dropped by $2,500 at the start of the US trading session.
Fears over a prolonged US trade war and subsequent recession fueled market downside, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index both falling another 3.5% after the open.

In ongoing market coverage, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter described the tariffs as the start of the “World War 3” of trade wars.”

“Two-day losses in the S&P 500 surpass -8% for a total of -$3.5 trillion in market cap. This is the largest 2-day drop since the pandemic in 2020,” it reported.
The Nasdaq 100 made history the day prior, recording its biggest single-day points loss ever.
The latest US jobs data in the form of the March nonfarm payrolls print, which beat expectations, faded into insignificance with markets already panicking.
Market expectations of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve nonetheless edged higher, with the odds for such a move coming at the Fed’s May meeting hitting 40%, per data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

e33f43bff6d73a0907a42ea081706b62,Cointelegraph,American Bitcoin’s ambition is to dominate mining — Hut 8 CEO,https://cointelegraph.com/news/inside-the-trump-linked-american-bitcoin-mining-ambitions-to-dominate-the-industry-hut-8-ceo," In an exclusive interview, Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot reveals how the Trump-backed American Bitcoin venture is aiming to dominate US mining and ultimately take its vision public. 
Earlier this week, Bitcoin mining giant Hut 8 revealed a partnership that includes two members of the Trump family — Donald Jr. and Eric — and its plans to launch a new mining venture, American Bitcoin. 
In an exclusive interview on Decentralize with Cointelegraph’s Byte-Sized Insight series, Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot shared new details about the venture’s vision, why the timing was right and how the company plans to scale.
“We’ve thought about splitting out our Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure businesses for some time,” Genoot said. “Meeting Eric and Don Jr., and seeing their deep passion for Bitcoin and infrastructure, was the perfect catalyst.”
According to Genoot, the goal is clear: to build one of the world’s largest and most efficient Bitcoin mining platforms, rooted in American soil and aligned with pro-Bitcoin sentiment growing under President Donald  Trump’s administration. “Eric told me, ‘I don’t want to get involved in anything that isn’t the biggest and the best,’” he said.
The move comes at a pivotal moment for US-based mining. With China out of the picture post-2021 crackdown, and Washington now openly exploring the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, America’s place in the global mining ecosystem is under transformation.
Still, size isn’t everything. Genoot emphasized that efficiency and cost-effectiveness are core to the strategy.

American Bitcoin’s structure allows it to mine BTC at low cost, accumulate more when the market allows, and potentially expand into other Bitcoin ecosystem services. Hut 8 currently holds over 10,000 BTC on its balance sheet, worth up to $1 billion depending on market conditions. American Bitcoin aims to surpass that.
And the company isn’t just bullish on Bitcoin; it’s bullish on power consumption. Genoot pushed back on criticism that mining wastes energy: 
Looking ahead, Hut 8’s mining spinoff has big ambitions. “Our focus is scaling. Our focus is taking this company public on a US exchange,” Genoot said. “You’ll hear more from us soon.”

aecdd3ca70736675c58ff180b8fa61f5,Cointelegraph,Has Michael Saylor’s Strategy built a house of cards?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-strategy-house-of-cards," Has Saylor pushed Strategy too far? With MSTR at the center of clashing leveraged ETFs and convertible stock plays, the market is making its own bets. 
Strategy Inc, formerly MicroStrategy, has discarded its core product, assumed a new identity, swallowed over half a million Bitcoin, spawned equity classes with double-digit yields, and inspired an arsenal of leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — a unique and significant market phenomenon.
Michael Saylor’s firm has constructed a comprehensive financial framework based around Bitcoin (BTC), tying its corporate performance directly to the cryptocurrency’s price fluctuations. As a result, Strategy’s common stock has evolved into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure, its preferred shares offer yields tied to cryptocurrency risk, and a series of leveraged and inverse ETFs now track its equity movements, all fundamentally connected to its substantial Bitcoin holdings.
Recently, there was an announcement of another purchase by MSTR (Strategy’s common equity) of close to $2 billion of BTC in one clip, inviting even more raised eyebrows and caution.
This concern is not merely because of Strategy’s bet on Bitcoin but the market architecture that has grown around it. A parallel financial ecosystem has emerged, binding its fate to a risk asset that, as Saylor himself notes, trades 24/7. He’s championed the idea that “volatility is vitality,” suggesting that this constant motion draws attention, sustains interest, and breathes life into the entire “Strategyverse” and its related equities.
To some, this is financial innovation in its purest form: bold, unhedged and transformative. To others, it is a fragile lattice of conviction and leverage, one black swan away from unraveling.
MicroStrategy, once a staid business intelligence software provider, has been reborn as Strategy Inc, a corporate avatar synonymous with Bitcoin. The company has made an unabashed leap from offering data analytics to becoming a full-throttle Bitcoin acquisition vehicle.
The numbers speak for themselves. As of March 30, Strategy holds 528,185 BTC, acquired for approximately $35.63 billion at an average price of about $67,458 per Bitcoin. The most recent tranche of BTC in 2025 involved the acquisition of 22,048 BTC for around $1.92 billion, at an average of roughly $86,969 per coin. Year-to-date, Strategy has achieved a BTC yield of 11.0%.
This shift has transformed MSTR into a proxy Bitcoin ETF of sorts, albeit with operational leverage and corporate risk baked in. But unlike the US Securities and Exchange Commission-blessed spot ETFs, MSTR offers amplified exposure: It behaves like Bitcoin, only more so due to the company’s use of leverage and financial engineering.

Now, with the introduction of STRK (8% yield) and STRF (10% yield), Strategy has expanded its reach. These preferred shares offer fixed-income-style returns, but their performance is deeply tethered to Bitcoin’s fate. When Bitcoin surges, yield-bearing holders cheer. They’re still promised yield when it falls, but their capital risk climbs.
Financial innovation? Yes. Structural risk? Most certainly.

When indexed to 100 at the start of 2025, the performance of Strategy and related instruments demonstrates the effects of volatility and leverage in the Bitcoin-correlated financial ecosystem. As of early April 2025, MSTR has declined moderately by approximately 8%, tracking the broader downward trajectory of Bitcoin itself, which is down around 16%.
The company’s preferred shares, STRF and STRK, have slightly appreciated above their initial indexed values, reflecting investor preference for dividend stability amid market volatility.
MSTU and MSTX have markedly underperformed, dropping around 37%–38% from their normalized starting points due to volatility drag and compounding losses inherent in leveraged daily reset structures.
This YTD snapshot underscores how leverage magnifies returns and the potential risks associated with short-term market movements.
Strategy’s operating income, still derived from its legacy software business, now plays second fiddle to its crypto balance sheet.
However, the firm hasn’t just stockpiled coins; it has created a latticework of financial instruments that reflect and refract BTC price action. MSTR is no longer merely equity; it has become a high-beta Bitcoin play. STRK and STRF are yield-bearing hybrids, offering fixed returns yet functioning like risk instruments in a crypto-linked treasury experiment.
The structural concern is this: By tying every new yield product, equity issuance and debt vehicle to Bitcoin, Strategy has effectively replaced diversification with correlation. Critics argue there is no hedge here, only degrees of bullishness.
This raises the concern that a company can maintain corporate solvency and investor trust when its financial ecosystem is built atop the volatility of a single, historically unstable asset.
Where there is heat, there will be leverage. The market has responded to Strategy’s gravitational pull by creating a suite of leveraged and inverse products tied to MSTR, giving retail and institutional players access to turbocharged Bitcoin exposure without holding the asset directly.
Investors seeking amplified returns in anticipation of price gains can deploy strategies such as MSTU (T Rex) or MSTX (Defiance), both offering 2x long daily returns, or MST3.L, which provides 3x long exposure listed in London.
Conversely, investors expecting price declines might choose SMST, offering 2x short exposure, or MSTS.L and 3SMI, each providing 3x short exposure listed in London.
These instruments are typically employed by traders looking for short-term directional bets and should be handled cautiously due to daily reset mechanics and volatility risks.
These are not traditional ETFs. They are complex, synthetic instruments with daily reset mechanisms and inherent decay risks. Volatility drag ensures that even in a sideways market, leveraged longs underperform. For shorts, the risk of a short squeeze, particularly in parabolic bull runs, is ever-present.

In practical terms, these products allow traders to speculate on MSTR’s price with minimal capital outlay. But they also amplify misalignment. A trader betting on Bitcoin’s month-long trend might find that their 3x long MSTR ETF underperforms expectations due to compounding losses on down days.
The strategic risk here lies in mismatch: Retail investors may perceive these ETFs as direct Bitcoin exposure with leverage. In reality, they are trading a proxy of a proxy, subject to corporate news, dilution and macro shifts.

Between 2020 and 2025, Strategy has executed over a dozen capital raises via convertible notes, ATM equity programs and, most recently, the STRF preferred offering priced at a 10% yield. The March 2025 raise helped fund the latest $1.92-billion Bitcoin buy.
It is not just about buying Bitcoin. It is about the market constructing a meta-structure where every market instrument, common stock, preferred shares and synthetic ETFs feeds into the same gravitational pull. Each capital raise buys more Bitcoin. Each purchase pushes up sentiment. Each ETF amplifies exposure. This feedback loop has become the hallmark of Strategy’s financial architecture.
With each new issuance, however, dilution risk grows. STRK and STRF investors depend not only on Strategy’s solvency but also on Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation. If BTC stumbles into a prolonged bear market, can those 10% yields continue? 
For investors, Strategy’s approach presents clear opportunities and risks. It offers a streamlined pathway for gaining exposure to Bitcoin through familiar financial instruments, combining elements of equity, fixed income and derivatives. At the same time, investors must carefully consider the volatility of Bitcoin itself, the potential impacts of dilution from continuous capital raises, and the overall health of Strategy’s balance sheet.
Ultimately, the investment outcome will heavily depend on the trajectory of cryptocurrency markets, Strategy’s financial management and evolving regulatory landscapes.
