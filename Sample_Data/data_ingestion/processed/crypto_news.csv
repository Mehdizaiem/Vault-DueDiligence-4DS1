fcd1faa605205566dd6a2290ce45d167,Cointelegraph,How to sell crypto via MetaMask: A beginner’s guide to cashing out,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-sell-crypto-via-meta-mask," To sell crypto via your MetaMask wallet, you need to be aware of swapping, bridging and using fiat off-ramps to convert your crypto into fiat. 
Not all tokens can be sold immediately. Airdropped or obscure tokens may lack liquidity or could be scams, so it’s important to check before attempting to cash out.
Swapping and bridging may be required. To sell, you might need to convert tokens to ETH or stablecoins and bridge them to the Ethereum mainnet.
MetaMask integrates fiat off-ramps. You can use the MetaMask Portfolio to sell ETH directly, but be prepared for KYC with third-party providers.
Non-KYC and P2P options exist. Platforms like Bisq or LocalCoinSwap allow trading without ID, but they carry more risk and require caution.
There are plenty of ways you might end up with a mix of different cryptocurrencies sitting in your MetaMask wallet.
Maybe you work in Web3 — as a developer, copywriter or designer — and your client paid you in their project’s native token.
Or maybe you’re part of a Bitcoin mining pool and occasionally receive rewards straight to your wallet.
You could be farming yield in decentralized finance (DeFi), earning annual percentage yield (APY) on your locked assets. Or, perhaps the most straightforward of all: You completed a few SocialFi tasks and received some community tokens via an airdrop.
Whatever the case, you’ve got crypto in your MetaMask — and now you want to turn it into cash.
In this guide, you’ll learn all the ways you can sell your crypto and withdraw the funds to your bank account or even in cash — whether you’re going through official Know Your Customer (KYC) channels or sticking to more private, non-KYC routes.
Before you can turn your tokens into cash, there are a few things you need to get sorted in MetaMask because “not all tokens are created equal.” It’s not always as simple as hitting a “sell” button — especially if you’ve just received tokens via an airdrop or from a lesser-known project.
Just because a token shows up in your wallet doesn’t mean it’s ready to be sold. In fact, many airdropped tokens aren’t listed on exchanges at all. That means there’s no market where you can sell them — not yet, anyway. You might see a price attached to the token, but without buyers or liquidity, that value isn’t something you can actually realize right now. So, while it’s great to receive free tokens, they may end up sitting idle in your wallet for a while.
Did you know? If you see a “100% sell fee detected” warning on a token, it’s likely a scam. Scammers airdrop these tokens, hoping you’ll try to sell or interact with them. But when you do, the smart contract takes the full amount — leaving you with nothing. Worse, some link to fake decentralized applications (DApps) that ask you to “claim” or “unlock” the tokens. Connecting your wallet or signing a transaction there can let scammers drain your real assets.
Sometimes, you’ll receive tokens that don’t even show up in MetaMask at first. That doesn’t mean they’re not there — it just means MetaMask doesn’t recognize them by default. You’ll need to add them manually by grabbing the token’s contract address (usually from the project’s official site or Etherscan) and importing it into your wallet. Once you do that, your balance will show up properly.
Similarly, if you want to receive any asset other than Ether (ETH), the “Import Tokens” option lets you manually add these missing tokens so they show up in the assets list.
Even if your tokens are visible in MetaMask and technically have value, that doesn’t always mean you can sell them for cash right away. Many smaller or newer tokens don’t have direct fiat trading pairs — so you won’t be able to exchange them straight into dollars or euros. 
To get around this, you’ll usually need to swap them for something more liquid, like ETH or a stablecoin such as USDC (USDC), which are more commonly supported by fiat off-ramps.
In some cases, your tokens might also be sitting on a different blockchain — like Arbitrum, BNB Chain or Polygon — while most fiat withdrawal options only support Ethereum mainnet. When that’s the case, you’ll need to bridge your tokens over to Ethereum before you can sell them.
One way to handle both of these steps — swapping and bridging — is by using platforms that combine them into a single flow. For example, with Symbiosis.finance, you can swap a token on one chain and receive a more widely accepted token on Ethereum, all in one transaction. This can save you a few steps and reduce the chance of user error when hopping between tools.
The simplest way to sell crypto that you hold on MetaMask is by using the application itself. Here’s what to do:
Open MetaMask portfolio: In your MetaMask extension or app, click the “Buy & Sell” button. This will take you to the MetaMask Portfolio site, where you can manage all your assets and begin the selling process.
Start the sale process: Click on “Move crypto” at the top of the page and select “Sell” from the dropdown options.
Choose your region and currency: MetaMask will ask for your country of residence and preferred fiat currency. This step ensures you’re shown accurate provider options and payout methods available in your area.
Enter sale amount: Select Ether and enter how much you’d like to convert.
Pick a payout option: Next, choose where you want the fiat to go. Depending on your region and provider availability, you might be able to send it to a bank account, PayPal or another method.
Compare offers: MetaMask aggregates offers from several third-party providers (like MoonPay, Transak, Sardine, etc.), showing you real-time exchange rates, fees and estimated payout times. Take a moment to compare and pick the best option for you.
Complete the sale: Once you’ve chosen a provider, MetaMask will guide you through sending the crypto. You’ll confirm the transaction in your wallet, and the funds will be transferred to the provider, who handles the fiat payout.
There are two things to keep in mind when using the MetaMask application:
Firstly, while the application itself might not ask you for KYC, the third-party providers will. So, expect to get your documents ready for this one.
Secondly, MetaMask’s sell feature only supports ETH on the Ethereum mainnet. This is where the bridging will come in as was explained earlier.
If you’d rather cash out your crypto through a centralized exchange, Coinbase is a popular option. It’s beginner-friendly, offers fiat withdrawals, and supports a wide range of assets. Just note: You’ll need to complete KYC verification before withdrawing any fiat.
Here’s how to do it, step by step:
First things first: You’ll need to move your funds from MetaMask to Coinbase.
Log in to your Coinbase account and hit “Send & Receive” at the top.
Switch to the “Receive” tab, pick the crypto you’re sending (like ETH or USDC), and copy the wallet address Coinbase gives you.
Make sure the network matches — for example, if you’re sending ETH, it should be on the Ethereum (ERC-20) network.
Now open MetaMask:
Click “Send,” paste in that Coinbase address, and enter how much you want to transfer.
Double-check the network — if you send it to the wrong one, your funds could disappear.
Hit “Confirm,” and your crypto should show up in Coinbase after a few minutes.
Once your funds land in Coinbase, it’s time to cash out.
Head to “Buy & Sell” at the top and switch to the “Sell” tab.
Choose the crypto you just received and decide how much you want to sell.
Pick where you want the money to go — like your linked bank account, PayPal or your Coinbase balance.
Review the details (including any fees), then hit “Sell.”
Did you know? When withdrawing via centralized exchanges, be cautious of minimum withdrawal amounts and any associated fees. Check these details in advance to make sure the limits and costs are acceptable to you before committing to this route.
With peer-to-peer (P2P), you’re not selling your crypto to the exchange. Instead, you’re selling it to another user. You choose a buyer based on their offer and preferred payment method (like bank transfer, Revolut, Wise, etc.). Once they send the money to your account, you release the crypto to them. The platform holds your crypto in escrow during the process, so no one can just disappear with your funds.
With centralized exchanges, you’ll have to complete KYC before you’re able to trade in this manner. 
Go to Trade > P2P.
Choose the coin you want to sell and browse the list of available buyers.
Select a deal, confirm the order, and wait for the buyer to make the payment.
Once the payment has arrived in your account, confirm it and release the crypto from escrow.
Did you know? Some peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchanges offer a “cash by mail” option, allowing users to send physical cash through postal services or couriers to settle transactions.
For those looking to convert cryptocurrency from their MetaMask wallet to fiat currency without undergoing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, there are still a few viable paths.
Decentralized P2P platforms let you trade directly with other users, much like their centralized counterparts, though often with minimal or no KYC requirements. 
LocalCoinSwap: A non-custodial P2P marketplace that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and payment methods, including cash. It offers escrow protection and emphasizes privacy.
Bisq: A fully decentralized exchange that supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Monero (XMR). It runs on a peer-to-peer protocol and doesn’t require user accounts or KYC.
However, without KYC, you’re responsible for vetting the person you’re trading with. Check their reputation, review any available trade history, and always follow platform safety guidelines.
Withdrawing funds from your MetaMask wallet using cryptocurrency ATMs — often referred to as Bitcoin ATMs — is an option that allows you to convert your digital assets into cash. Here’s how you can approach this method:
Locate a cryptocurrency ATM: Begin by finding a cryptocurrency ATM in your vicinity. Websites like CoinATMRadar provide directories of Bitcoin ATM locations worldwide, detailing the services they offer and the cryptocurrencies they support.
Prepare your MetaMask wallet: Ensure that the cryptocurrency you intend to withdraw is supported by the ATM. Bitcoin ATMs predominantly support Bitcoin (BTC), so you may need to use a decentralized exchange (DEX) to swap your current tokens for BTC within your MetaMask wallet. Be mindful of transaction fees and exchange rates during this process.
Initiate the withdrawal process: At the ATM, select the option to withdraw cash. The machine will prompt you to specify the amount you wish to withdraw and provide a QR code representing the ATM’s wallet address.
Transfer funds from MetaMask: Using your MetaMask wallet, scan the QR code provided by the ATM to input the recipient address accurately. Enter the exact amount of cryptocurrency required and confirm the transaction. Be aware that network congestion can affect transaction times.
Collect your cash: Once the blockchain confirms the transaction, the ATM will dispense the equivalent amount in cash, minus any applicable fees. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to longer, depending on network conditions.
When using crypto ATMs, you should expect very high fees, and while small transactions don’t usually require KYC, larger ones still might.
Taxes aren’t the most exciting topic, but they matter when converting crypto from a MetaMask wallet into fiat. Selling crypto, whether through MetaMask, an exchange or a P2P deal, may trigger a taxable event, and understanding the applicable rules is essential.
In most countries, including the US, selling crypto for fiat (like US dollars, euros, etc.) is treated like selling property. That means if you bought ETH at $1,000 and sold it later for $1,500, you’ve made a $500 capital gain — and that’s usually taxable.
Even swapping one crypto for another (say, ETH for USDC) can trigger the same kind of tax obligation, even if no fiat is involved. So, yeah, it’s not just cashing out that counts — any trade can be reportable.
To stay on top of it, keep a record of:
When you bought and sold each asset
How much you bought and/or sold
What it was worth in fiat at the time
Any fees paid along the way.
These details make life way easier when tax season rolls around — or if your accountant gives you that look.
Crypto laws aren’t one-size-fits-all. Every country has its own stance, and even within the same country, rules can vary depending on how you’re using crypto.
In the US, for example, selling crypto could fall under capital gains tax rules or even money transmission laws, depending on how you’re moving the funds. Other countries might have more lenient — or much stricter — regulations.
So, here’s what to do:
Look up your local crypto tax laws (even if they seem vague or outdated).
Stay current — regulations are evolving fast.
Talk to a pro if you’re unsure. A crypto-savvy accountant or legal adviser can help you avoid nasty surprises.
Even if you’re using non-KYC methods or decentralized tools, tax authorities may still expect a full report. Being proactive about it will save you headaches later — and might even save you money.
Happy cashing out!

6034707c43205510c9f2cba261199484,Cointelegraph,10-year Treasury yield falls to 4% as DXY softens — Is it time to buy the Bitcoin price dip?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/10-year-treasury-yield-falls-to-4-as-dxy-softens-is-it-time-to-buy-the-bitcoin-price-dip," Will the US-led trade war lead to a golden buying opportunity in Bitcoin price or further downside in the short term? 
On April 3, yields on long-term US government debt fell to their lowest levels in six months as investors reacted to growing concerns over the global trade war and the weakening of the US dollar. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly touched 4.0%, down from 4.4% a week earlier, signaling strong demand from buyers.

At first glance, a higher risk of economic recession may seem negative for Bitcoin (BTC). However, lower returns from fixed-income investments encourage allocations to alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Over time, traders are likely to reduce exposure to bonds, particularly if inflation rises. As a result, the path to a Bitcoin all-time high in 2025 remains plausible.
One could argue that the recently announced US import tariffs negatively impact corporate profitability, forcing some companies to deleverage and, in turn, reducing market liquidity. Ultimately, any measure that increases risk aversion tends to have a short-term negative effect on Bitcoin, particularly given its strong correlation with the S&P 500 index.
Axel Merk, chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Merk Investments, said that tariffs create a “supply shock,” meaning the reduced availability of goods and services due to rising prices causes an imbalance relative to demand. This effect is amplified if interest rates are declining, potentially paving the way for inflationary pressure.

Even if one does not view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, the appeal of fixed-income investments diminishes significantly in such a scenario. Moreover, if just 5% of the world’s $140 trillion bond market seeks higher returns elsewhere, it could translate into $7 trillion in potential inflows into stocks, commodities, real estate, gold, and Bitcoin.
Gold surged to a $21 trillion market capitalization as it made consecutive all-time highs, and it still has the potential for significant price upside. Higher prices allow previously unprofitable mining operations to resume and it encourages further investment in exploration, extraction, and refining. As production expands, the supply growth will naturally act as a limiting factor on gold’s long-term bull run.
Regardless of trends in US interest rates, the US dollar has weakened against a basket of foreign currencies, as measured by the DXY Index. On April 3, the index dropped to 102, its lowest level in six months. A decline in confidence in the US dollar, even in relative terms, could encourage other nations to explore alternative stores of value, including Bitcoin.

This transition does not happen overnight, but the trade war could lead to a gradual shift away from the US dollar, particularly among countries that feel pressured by its dominant role. While no one expects a return to the gold standard or Bitcoin to become a major component of national reserves, any movement away from the dollar strengthens Bitcoin’s long-term upside potential and reinforces its position as an alternative asset.

To put things in perspective, Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore collectively hold $2.63 trillion in US Treasuries. If these regions choose to retaliate, bond yields could reverse their trend, increasing the cost of new debt issuance for the US government and further weakening the dollar. In such a scenario, investors would likely avoid adding exposure to stocks, ultimately favoring scarce alternative assets like Bitcoin.
Timing Bitcoin’s market bottom is nearly impossible, but the fact that the $82,000 support level held despite worsening global economic uncertainty is an encouraging sign of its resilience.

Cango, a publicly traded Chinese conglomerate, has agreed to sell its legacy China operations to an entity associated with peer Bitmain in a bid to go all-in on Bitcoin (BTC) mining, according to a report by The Miner Mag. 
Cango agreed to sell its legacy Chinese auto financing business to Ursalpha Digital Limited in a $352 million deal, according to the report.
 Additionally, Bitmain is reportedly transferring 32 exahashes per second (EH/s) to Cango. The deal effectively brings Bitmain’s mining assets to the public market, The Miner Mag said.
Exahashes measure a miner’s contribution to the Bitcoin network’s hashrate, the total computing power securing the network.
The Miner Mag said Ursalpha Digital Limited has the same corporate address and founding director as Antalpha, an entity ultimately controlled by the chairman of Bitcoin miner Bitmain.

Bitmain has experienced US scrutiny after the country blacklisted its artificial intelligence affiliate Sopghgo, Bloomberg reported. 
According to Bloomberg, Bitmain has a working relationship with American Bitcoin, a Trump-family-affiliated mining entity created in March as part of a deal with Hut 8, a provider of power and computing infrastructure. 
On March 31, Hut 8 bought a majority ownership interest in American Bitcoin (formerly American Data Centers), whose founders include US President Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. 
Hut 8 has transferred its Bitcoin mining equipment to American Bitcoin, which is reportedly mulling an initial public offering (IPO), according to Bloomberg. 
The companies said that American Bitcoin will focus on crypto mining, while Hut 8 targets data center infrastructure for applications such as high-performance computing. 
In 2025, Bitcoin mining stocks have struggled amid declining cryptocurrency prices and pressure on business models caused by the Bitcoin network’s April halving, according to a JPMorgan research note shared with Cointelegraph.
Every four years, the amount of BTC mined per “block” — a bundle of transaction data stored on the chain — is cut in half. April’s halving slashed mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.

cd42ed4c86be762452cd63bb6f8d3312,Cointelegraph,Pre-seed crypto startup deals have grown 767% since 2021: Report,https://cointelegraph.com/news/pre-seed-bitcoin-funding-deals-report," Bitcoin-specific startups accounted for only about 6% of the total crypto funding deals in 2024, according to a report from Trammell Venture Partners. 
The number of pre-seed funding rounds for Bitcoin (BTC) startup companies has grown by 767% since 2021, according to a report from venture capital firm Trammell Venture Partners (TVP).
Bitcoin pre-seed transactions increased 50% year-over-year in 2024, with a 27.5% year-over-year increase in the number of startup companies funded.
Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director, attributed the increased deals to the robust security of the BTC network:
However, the capital raised in Bitcoin pre-seed funding rounds declined by over 22% in 2024, with the median funding round size and the median startup valuation steadily declining from 2021 to 2023.

The value of funding rounds reclaimed some lost ground in 2024 but failed to reach highs established during the previous bull cycle in 2021, primarily due to unclear crypto regulations in the United States under the previous Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) leadership.
More recently, macroeconomic uncertainty due to fears of a prolonged trade war, relatively high interest rates, and the possibility of a recession in the United States have also eroded the risk appetite for speculative assets like crypto.

In January, Deng Chao, CEO of institutional asset manager HashKey Capital, told Cointelegraph that pro-crypto regulations in the United States would increase VC investment in the sector in 2025.
However, the executive warned that macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical turmoil could increase price volatility and disrupt the trend brought on by positive regulatory tailwinds.
On April 2, US President Donald Trump signed a sweeping tariff order establishing a 10% baseline tariff on import goods from all countries and a regime of reciprocal trade tariffs on trading partners that sent financial markets tumbling.

Risk-on assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies typically suffer during trade wars and macroeconomic uncertainty, as investors flee risk assets for safer alternatives such as cash, government securities, and durable commodities.
Venture capital firm Haun Ventures invested $1.5 billion into crypto firms in 2022 but recently announced it seeks to raise only $1 billion in the first half of 2025, citing changed market conditions.
Similarly, analysts at Galaxy Digital also predicted a 50% year-over-year rise in VC-led crypto investments in 2025 but said that VC funding will fail to reach highs established in 2021–2022.

Should traders expect a relief rally due to oversold conditions? 
Bitcoin (BTC) and US stock markets all sold off sharply after US President Donald Trump shook up financial markets by announcing a list of reciprocal tariffs on several countries. 
On April 3, the S&P 500 saw a 4.2% drop at market open, its most significant single-day decline since June 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.41%, to 40,785.41 from 42,225.32, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.23%. Overall, $1.6 trillion in value was wiped out from US stock at the market open. 
Bitcoin’s value dropped by 8%, but a positive is bulls seem capable of defending the $80,000 support level. These steep declines essentially stem from uncertainty surrounding the new tariffs and amplify investors’ concerns about impending recession.

Data from CoinGecko suggests that the total crypto market has dropped 6.8% over the past 24 hours and it seems unlikely that a relief rally is viable in the short-term.

According to CoinGlass, in the past 24 hours, more than 200,000 traders were liquidated, with the total amount exceeding $573.4 million. The largest liquidation occurred on Binance, with an ETH/USDT position worth $11.97 million being force closed.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s open interest dropped below $50 billion, reducing market leverage.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed the first trip below $82,000 for BTC/USD since the start of the month.
After initially surging as high as $88,580 as the US government unveiled reciprocal trade tariffs, Bitcoin soon ran out of steam as the reality of the stronger-than-expected measures hit home.
US stocks then followed, with the S&P 500 down over 4% on the day at the time of writing.
“Today's -3.7% drop puts the S&P 500 on track for its largest daily decline since the 2020 pandemic lockdowns,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of a reaction on X.

Thereafter, US initial jobless claims came in below estimates, at 219,000 versus the anticipated 228,000, per data from the US Department of Labor (DoL).
“The previous week's level was revised up by 1,000 from 224,000 to 225,000. The 4-week moving average was 223,000, a decrease of 1,250 from the previous week's revised average. The previous week's average was revised up by 250 from 224,000 to 224,250,” an official press release stated.
Stronger labor market trends are traditionally associated with weaker risk-asset performance as they imply that policymakers can keep financial conditions tighter for longer.
Data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool nonetheless continued to see markets favor an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve at the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

“As recession odds rise, markets think that the Fed will be forced to cut rates as soon as next month,” Kobeissi added.
BTC price action predictably continued to disappoint on short timeframes as $80,000 support became uncomfortably close.

3fc6137fb4ad435b08efb98e9389adf5,Cointelegraph,How long will Bitcoin’s price consolidation last?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-long-will-the-bitcoin-consolidation-last," Bitcoin’s price consolidation looks set to continue as neutral funding rates and macroeconomic uncertainty highlight indecisiveness among traders. 
Bitcoin (BTC) price has been consolidating in a wide range between $80,000 to $88,500 since March 12. 
Data suggests that Bitcoin’s consolidation may continue for some time, with onchain indicators pointing to the continuation of the “broader downtrend.” The key question that remains is when Bitcoin’s consolidation will end.

One of the clearest signs that there is more choppy price action ahead for Bitcoin is the presence of muted funding rates in the BTC futures markets.
Key points:
Funding rates are periodic payments made between long and short traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep prices aligned with the spot market.
When this metric turns negative, it means short sellers are paying long holders, indicating that bearish sentiment dominates.
BTC funding rates have been oscillating around 0% since late February, indicating indecisiveness dominates the market.

When funding rates are zero, the cost of holding positions is minimal, reducing pressure on traders to exit longs or shorts and leading to price consolidation.
Commenting on the funding rate, crypto analyst Axel Adler Junior said that Bitcoin’s average funding rate on major exchanges “has dropped into negative territory,” currently sitting just above zero.
According to the analyst, positive signals from the US Federal Reserve and the Trump administration could renew fresh inflows into the market, “potentially triggering the start of a new rally.”
Several onchain metrics suggest Bitcoin’s April 2 rally to $87,500 was just a “relief rally within a broader downtrend rather than the beginning of a sustained reversal,” according to market intelligence firm Glassnode.
In its latest market report, Glassnode found that the 90-day simple moving average of Bitcoin’s Realized Profit/Loss Ratio had declined significantly since January, despite repeated rallies in the $76,000–$80,000 range.
These brief profit-driven surges have failed to end the ongoing consolidation, suggesting that the “macro picture remains one of generally weaker liquidity and deteriorating investor profitability,” it said.

An accompanying chart shows data from the onchain volume-weighted prices metric, which calculates a price level weighted by the volume of coins moved onchain over a specific timeframe.
Using this, Glassnode can compare when and how much capital was actually moved in the last 1 month compared to the last 6 months, giving a direct reflection of market trends.

Anticipation of a breakout in BTC price lingers in the background, as suggested by Bitcoin’s volatility indicator.
Key points:
Tightening Bollinger Bands conditions indicate that a breakout might be very close.
The weekly Bollinger Bandwidth is at an extremely oversold level, touching its lower green line.
The width of the Bollinger Bands is as tight as it was between July 2024 and November 2024 when it consolidated between $55,000 and $69,000, the 2021 all-time high.
BTC/USD then rallied 60% from $67,500 in October 2026 to its previous high of $106,000 reached in December 2024.
The indicator was also this tight between July 2023 and October 2023, preceding a 176% rally in BTC price from $24,400 to $73,800 on March 14, 2024.

If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could soon break out of consolidation to stage a massive upward move over the next few weeks.

The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast looks at Bitcoin’s scalability, security and its future as a global financial force. 
Bitcoin’s (BTC) journey from a radical experiment to a trillion-dollar asset has been fueled by grand narratives: Digital gold, decentralized money and an alternative financial system. Beyond the hype, how does Bitcoin remain true to its core values? 
That’s the central theme of the latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, where hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson are joined by Charlie Spears, co-founder of Blockspace Media, to unpack Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system.
From the outset, Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized alternative to traditional money.
But as adoption has surged, so too has the debate over its scalability and usability. Jenkinson began the conversation by explaining the origins of the original cryptocurrency and how that has shifted over time:
The discussion underscores the growing importance of layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which aim to make Bitcoin practical for everyday transactions by enabling users to transact in satoshis — the smallest unit of Bitcoin — rather than traditional currencies.

Debates over Bitcoin’s direction often center on its philosophical roots. Some purists argue that any modification risks altering the essence of what makes Bitcoin unique. 
Others see thoughtful updates as a way to reinforce its role as a global financial system. Spears compares this to interpreting historical texts: 
The discussion highlights how some proposed upgrades aren’t new but were initially removed as a precaution. Now, with Bitcoin’s maturity, developers are considering reinstating them to improve functionality. 
“Bitcoin is in the hands of its users,” Spears emphasizes. “We get to decide what it should be, just as much as those who were there 15 years ago.”
As Bitcoin continues to evolve, The Clear Crypto Podcast cuts through the noise to deliver insightful conversations about where it’s headed next.

Magazine: SEC’s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered

72a3b2e9eb98f9e264f44728c79324f1,Cointelegraph,CEX listings outperform Nasdaq and Dow IPOs with 80% average returns,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-token-listings-outperform-stocks-80-roi," CEX listings had an average return of over 80% during the past 180 days, outperforming the NYSE and Nasdaq’s average IPO returns. 
Cryptocurrency listings have outperformed the average of traditional stock listings, despite recent community criticism regarding the manipulation potential of token listings on centralized exchanges.
Token listing procedures on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) drew significant controversy after Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, co-founder and former CEO of Binance, called the process flawed after disappointing performances of some token listings.
Despite the criticism, crypto exchanges have outperformed traditional stock exchanges in terms of listings with positive returns on investment (ROI) and average ROI, according to an April 3 CoinMarketCap report shared exclusively with Cointelegraph.
Over the past 180 days, crypto exchange listings had an average return of over 80%, outperforming the largest traditional stock indexes such as the Nasdaq and Dow Jones, as well as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

The 80% return refers to the average performance of all listed tokens by the seven major exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, Bitget, Gate and KuCoin.
Moreover, 68% of crypto exchange listings boasted a positive ROI, outperforming the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE) 54% and the Nasdaq’s 51%.

“This data suggests that crypto exchanges have made progress in refining their listing,” the report said.

Cryptocurrencies listed on CEXs generally see high demand from investors as the exchanges provide significant new liquidity that can boost the coins’ price performances after listing.
Token-listing criteria on CEXs started garnering attention in November 2024, after Tron founder Justin Sun claimed that Coinbase allegedly asked for $330 million in total fees to list Tron (TRX), a surprising allegation since Coinbase claims to charge no fees for listing new cryptocurrencies.

Recent investor disappointment with some token listings may stem from historic profit expectations due to the significant upside of numerous CEX-listed tokens.
Still, the returns of a cryptocurrency after listing depend on the wider market appetite, a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding:
“Crypto investors’ expectations for new listings to perform well are understandable and often shaped by the historic success” of CEX listings, added the spokesperson.
Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, listed 77 cryptocurrencies throughout 2023 and 2024, with a 0% delisting rate.
Binance announced a community voting mechanism for token listings on March 9, to make the listing process more decentralized.

18685324be3310752ea222e37c937be6,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin price risks drop to $71K as Trump tariffs hurt US business outlook,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-71k-target-tariffs-deal-rare-us-business-outlook-slump," Bitcoin may see a ""sizeable bounce"" at $71,000 if US trade tariffs result in further BTC price pressure, new analysis predicts. 
Bitcoin (BTC) faces “very high risk” conditions from US trade tariffs, which could spark a slump to $71,000.
In his latest analysis, Charles Edwards, the founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, warned about the impact of “higher than expected” US trade tariffs.
Bitcoin reacted noticeably worse than US stocks after President Donald Trump announced worldwide reciprocal trade tariffs on April 2.
BTC/USD fell up to 8.5% on the day, while the S&P 500 managed to end the Wall Street trading session 0.7% higher.
Edwards said that US business expectations are reflecting the type of uncertainty seen only three times since the turn of the millennium.
“Consider this as tariffs come in higher than expected. The Philly Fed Business Outlook survey is showing expectations today comparable to 2000, 2008 and 2022,” he told X followers.
An accompanying chart showed the Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey (BOS) back under 15 for the first time since the start of 2024. Late 2022 was the pit of the most recent crypto bear market when BTC/USD reversed at $15,600.

In Capriole’s latest market update on March 31, Edwards acknowledged that BOS data can produce unreliable signals regarding market sentiment but argued that it should not be ignored.
“While no guarantee of the future outlook (this metric does have false signals) this is a data reading we have had before at very high risk zones (year 2000, 2008 and 2022), telling us to keep a very open mind,” he wrote, adding: 
For Bitcoin, a key level to watch in the tariff aftermath is $91,000, with Capriole suggesting that US macroeconomic moves would “decide the ultimate technical trend from here.”
“All else equal, a daily close above $91K would be a strong bullish reclaim signal,” the update explained alongside the weekly BTC/USD chart.

As Cointelegraph reported, a silver lining for crypto and risk assets could come in the form of increasing global liquidity.

In the US, the Fed has already begun to loosen tight financial policy, with bets on a return to so-called quantitative easing (QE) varying.
“How long until the Powell printer starts humming?” Edwards queried.
M2 money supply, meanwhile, is due for an “influx,” something which has historically spawned major BTC price upside.
“The BIG takeaway (the most important observation) is that a big M2 influx is coming. The exact date is less important,” analyst Colin Talks Crypto predicted in an X thread this week.
