9e571cb048329b032725bc5beaac7cf2,Cointelegraph,"Crypto, DeFi may widen wealth gap, destabilize finance: BIS report",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-adoption-critical-mass-regulation-wealth-gap-bis," The Bank for International Settlements warns that crypto and stablecoins may destabilize finance and widen inequality, urging stronger regulation in response. 
The growing adoption of cryptocurrencies may pose risks to the traditional financial system and exacerbate wealth inequality, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
In an April 15 report, the BIS warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) have “reached a critical mass,” with investor protection becoming a “significant concern for regulators.”
The size of the crypto market signals that authorities should be worried about the “stability of crypto over and above the role it may have for TradFi and the real economy,” the report states, highlighting the role of stablecoins, which the BIS said have “become the means through which participants transfer value within crypto.”
The report calls for targeted stablecoin regulation on stability and reserve asset requirements that will guarantee the redemption of stablecoins for US dollars during “stressed market conditions.”

The report comes two weeks after the US House Financial Services Committee passed the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy, or STABLE Act, with a 32–17 vote on April 2.
The STABLE Act aims to create a clear regulatory framework for dollar-denominated payment stablecoins, emphasizing transparency and consumer protection.
On March 13, the GENIUS Act, short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, passed the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 18–6. The act aims to establish collateralization guidelines and require full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws from stablecoin issuers.

The BIS also raised concerns about how crypto markets may worsen income inequality by enabling larger investors to capitalize on the emotions of less sophisticated retail participants, as seen during the FTX collapse in 2022.
“As prices tumbled in 2022, users actually traded more,” the BIS report noted. “Most disturbingly, large bitcoin holders (“whales”) were selling as ordinary retail investors (“krill”) were buying.” It added:
The report concludes that DeFi and TradFi have similar underlying economic drivers, but DeFi’s “distinctive features,” like “smart contract and composability,” present new challenges that need proactive regulatory interventions to “safeguard financial stability, while fostering innovation.”

8436d214cc93f9a6f0a6d7e1c24751ba,Cointelegraph,"$400M Web3 investment fund ABCDE halts new investments, fundraising",https://cointelegraph.com/news/400-m-web3-investment-fund-abcde-halts-investments-fundraising," Web3 fund ABCDE halts new investments and fundraising to support existing projects and launch its new crypto incubator, Vernal. 
Web3 and blockchain-focused investment fund ABCDE is halting new investments, but the $400 million fund remains committed to supporting its existing projects.
In an April 19 X post, ABCDE co-founder and Huobi exchange founder Du Jun said the $400 million fund will no longer invest in new projects or raise capital for the second phase of the fund.
However, Jun said the fund will continue to “post-investment support and exit arrangements of existing projects” to ensure the firm’s commitment to entrepreneurs and liquidity providers (LPs).
“My personal work focus will also gradually shift from financial investment in the primary market to strategic investment-led and deep incubation-based, focusing more on industrial synergy and long-term value creation,” Jun added.
The announcement comes nearly three months after ABCDE’s last investment into an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution, Soon (Solana Optimistic Network), which raised $22 million through a non-fungible token sale to mark the launch of its mainnet, Cointelegraph reported on Jan. 22.
The Soon mainnet claims to outperform Solana in speed and efficiency, delivering average block times of 50 milliseconds compared to Solana’s 400 milliseconds.
ABCDE is a $400 million fund, with 28% of its investments in Bitcoin (BTC) scaling technology, 16% in Ethereum liquid staking derivatives finance (LSDFi) infrastructure, and an additional 12% invested in L2s, restaking and smart contract platforms, Cryptorank data shows.
ABCDE has invested over $40 million worth of capital into over 30 projects over the past three years, with an internal rate of return (IRR) “still at the global leading level,” despite the current market environment, Jun said.

ABCDE’s suspension of fundraising efforts was announced a month after the fund’s co-founder launched a new incubator brand, Vernal.
The new incubator is set to announce its shareholders and incubation rules for the first batch of projects in May, along with its first investments.
Jun said that the decision to halt ABCDE’s fundraising efforts was not made due to financial constraints or lack of funds but because of a fundamental concern for the current development trajectory of the crypto industry.

“Frankly speaking, I am increasingly unable to agree with the current ecological atmosphere of the primary market,” Jun said in an April 19 X post, adding:
“What is more worrying is that some primary funds not only have no reflection on this, but also hype up their ‘listed projects’ and short-term market value performance, but never mention the value creation of the projects themselves,” he added.
Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has urged fourth-generation cryptocurrency projects to embrace more collaborative tokenomics to compete with major centralized tech companies entering the crypto industry.
“The problem right now, with the way we’ve done things in the cryptocurrency space, is the tokenomics and the market structure are intrinsically adversarial. It’s sum 0,” Hoskinson said at Paris Blockchain Week on April 9. “Instead of picking a fight, what you have to do is you have to find tokenomics and market structure that allows you to be in a cooperative equilibrium.”
“You can’t build a global ecosystem this way, and you can’t win this way,” he added. “Because here’s the thing. The incumbents are much larger.”

372e7281568a0c81a9e190f201a3308d,Cointelegraph,Trump firing Powell would be a ‘very bad precedent to set’ — Pompliano,https://cointelegraph.com/news/united-states-donald-trump-jerome-powell-consequences-firing-federal-reserve," Anthony Pompliano agrees with critics claiming the Federal Reserve isn’t truly independent but says firing its chair will just make things worse. 
Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano says that US President Donald Trump shouldn’t follow through on his recent threat to fire the head of the US Federal Reserve, saying it would set a dangerous precedent — especially considering the true motive behind it.
“I do not believe that the President of the United States should come in and unilaterally fire the Fed President,” Pompliano said in a video posted on X on April 18.
Pompliano said, “Where you have a disagreement and then the firing, I think that’s not really the area that we want to go into.”
It comes after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social to accuse Fed chair Jerome Powell of being too slow to cut interest rates. “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump said on April 17.
Pompliano explained that while the Fed is meant to operate independently, he agrees with critics who argue it’s not truly independent. “The Fed, I think, is highly politicized, even though they pretend not to be,” he said.
Pompliano acknowledged his own criticism of the Fed, saying he's not exactly a fan, but emphasized that even if the Fed has made mistakes, responding in kind isn't the right approach.
“I still think that just because somebody else is doing something wrong doesn't mean that you should do something wrong,” Pompliano said.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren recently warned that if Trump eventually moves to fire Powell, it could undermine investor confidence in the integrity of US capital markets and trigger a financial crash. 
“A big part of our economy strong, and a big part of the world economy strong, is the idea that the big pieces move independently of politics,” Warren said during an appearance on CNBC.

Lower interest rates often lead to increased liquidity, which has historically led to higher prices of perceived riskier assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
It comes not long after Powell said establishing a stablecoins legal framework was a “good idea.” 
In an April 16 panel at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell said, “The climate is changing, and you’re moving into more mainstreaming of that whole sector, so Congress is again looking [...] at a legal framework for stablecoins.”

ef6256240789dee6ea7231bb1d4b2ef7,Cointelegraph,"Lyn Alden lowers Bitcoin forecast after ‘tariff kerfuffle,’ eyes liquidity",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-year-end-prediction-lowered-lyn-alden-liquidity-tariffs," Macroeconomist Lyn Alden says a period similar to the 2003–2007 run-up before the global financial crisis could play in Bitcoin’s favor. 
Macroeconomist Lyn Alden expects Bitcoin to finish 2025 higher than its current price of around $85,000, though she says it would have been much higher if not for US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement in February.
“Before all this tariff kerfuffle, I would have had a higher price target,” Alden told Natalie Brunell on the April 17 episode of Coin Stories. “My guess is that we end up higher at the end of the year than we are now, at least,” she added.
However, she said that a “massive liquidity unlock” could be the catalyst needed for Bitcoin (BTC) to reach more optimistic targets, similar to those before the tariffs were introduced.
For example, if the US bond market “broke” and the US Federal Reserve had to step in with measures like yield curve control or heavy quantitative easing (QE), Alden explained.
While Alden said that there is a “good chance” Bitcoin reclaims the $100,000 price level before the end of the year, she emphasized that broader financial market “down days” will remain a challenge for the asset, especially since Bitcoin trades 24/7, unlike traditional stock markets with trading hours.
“Because it trades 24/7, if people are worried about how things are going to open on Monday, some pools of capital can sell their Bitcoin on a Sunday and prepare,” she said. 
Alden explained that crypto's round-the-clock trading contributes to its ""volatile pricing,"" particularly when traditional financial markets are “freaking out.”
At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $84,950, according to CoinMarketCap data.
However, Alden said Bitcoin can “disconnect” from the Nasdaq 100, especially in situations that “hurt Nasdaq margins” without affecting global liquidity. As an example, she pointed to a potential repeat of the five years leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis, which she believes could be favorable for Bitcoin.

She pointed to the 2003–2007 period, where there was a weaker US dollar cycle, and while there wasn’t a mass exodus of capital, it did flow into “emerging markets,” commodities, gold, and other assets — with US stocks not “really being the place to be.”
Alden wrote in a September research report that Bitcoin moves in the direction of global M2 83% of the time in a given 12-month period. 
The research termed “Bitcoin a Global Liquidity Barometer” compared Bitcoin to other major asset classes such as SPX, gold and VT, and BTC topped the correlation index concerning global liquidity.

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

4d7a62e1e416df31f170b394bef04ff2,Cointelegraph,Rare market volatility signal points to higher Bitcoin price in 6 to 12 months — Dan Tapiero,https://cointelegraph.com/news/rare-market-volatility-signal-points-to-higher-bitcoin-price-in-6-to-12-months-dan-tapiero," Analysts have conflicting views on whether record volatility within the US equities markets will have a positive or negative impact on Bitcoin price in the long term. 
On April 7, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) posted a rare spike to 60, a level seen as a barometer of extreme market fear and uncertainty. According to Dan Tapiero, CEO of 10Tfund, the VIX has hit 60 only five times in the last 35 years, and data suggests a rebound for risk assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) in 6 to 12 months. 
The VIX, which is widely considered a ""fear gauge,"" reflects investor expectations of market turbulence based on S&P 500 options trading. As illustrated in the chart, extreme spikes were seen in 2008 and 2020, typically coinciding with market bottoms, where panic-driven sellers paved the way for generational market entries. 
In light of that, Tapiero argued that the current spike is no different, with the worst of market fears likely ""priced in,"" setting the stage for a positive future. Tapiero said that “odds favor better future.”  
Likewise, Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), supported Tapiero’s claim and said that tech stocks are at their most oversold since the COVID-19 crash, with over 55% of Nasdaq 100 stocks posting a 14-day RSI below 30. Such a market signal has occurred only during major crises like the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
Bittel explained that after the VIX touched 60 last week, it implied peak uncertainty, which breeds fear in investors’ minds. Briefly touching on the US Investors Intelligence Survey, Bittel compared the current bullish sentiment of 23.6% to the lowest reading since December 2008. 
Additionally, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) survey respondents are currently 62% bearish, reflecting the highest bearish reading since March 2009. Bittel said,
This widespread fear, alongside a rare VIX spike, sets up for market entries in assets like Bitcoin, as the recovery of market liquidity will inevitably flow back into risk-on assets.

While macroeconomic experts highlighted the possibility of a bullish outcome for risk assets, markets analyst Tony Severino suggested that the Bitcoin/VIX ratio might also lead to a bear market. In a recent X post, Severino predicted that Bitcoin could have already peaked this cycle, but remained open about a possible change in opinion by the end of April. 
As illustrated in the chart, Severino noted a sell signal at the beginning of January. The analyst used the Elliott Wave theory model to pinpoint the current bearish conditions and said that it is still early to say that Bitcoin will turn bullish based on the VIX correlation.

b8941102d9c42e3fd988e85fd81e600d,Cointelegraph,"Price predictions 4/18: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, LEO, LINK, AVAX",https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-predictions-4-18-btc-eth-xrp-bnb-sol-doge-ada-leo-link-avax," Bitcoin trades in a tightening range, signalling that range expansion is likely to occur in the near future. 
Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight range for a few days, but a minor positive is that the bulls have kept the price above $83,000. Usually, a low volatility period is followed by a range expansion, but it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty.
Cryptocurrency analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s prospects because gold’s rally in 2017 and 2020 was followed by a sharp rise in Bitcoin's price. Theya head of growth Joe Consorti said in a post on X that Bitcoin follows gold with a lag of roughly 100 to 150 days. 
If Bitcoin moves as per Consorti’s expectations, a new all-time high could be hit between Q3 and Q4 of 2025. On similar lines, trading and analytics account Cryptollica projected a medium-term target of $155,000 for Bitcoin.
Along with Bitcoin, analysts are also bullish on altcoins. Swiss bank Sygnum said in its Q2 2025 investment outlook that improved regulations for crypto use cases have prepared the ground for a strong altcoins rally in the second quarter, as “none of the positive developments have been priced in.”
Could Bitcoin and the altcoins break above their respective overhead resistance levels and start a recovery? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
Bitcoin has been trading between the 20-day exponential moving average ($83,463) and the 200-day simple moving average ($87,857), indicating a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.
If the 20-day EMA cracks, the selling could pick up, and the BTC/USDT pair may slide to $78,500 and then to $73,777. Buyers are expected to defend the $73,777 level with all their might because a break below it may signal the start of a downtrend.
On the contrary, a break and close above the 200-day SMA indicates that the corrective phase may be over. The pair could climb to $95,000 and eventually to the psychologically critical level of $100,000.
Ether (ETH) has been trading between the $1,368 support and the $1,754 resistance, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.
The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest a slight edge to the sellers. If the price slips below $1,471, the ETH/USDT pair could descend to $1,368. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $1,368 support because a break below it may sink the pair to $1,150.
On the upside, the bulls are likely to face stiff resistance in the zone between the 20-day EMA ($1,676) and $1,754. A break and close above the resistance zone could propel the pair to the breakdown level of $2,111.
The bears have failed to sink XRP (XRP) below the $2 support, suggesting a lack of selling pressure at lower levels.
The bulls will try to start a recovery, which could reach the 50-day SMA ($2.23). This is an essential short-term level to keep an eye on because a break above it opens the doors for a rally to the resistance line. Buyers will have to push the price above the resistance line to signal a short-term trend change.
Alternatively, a break below the $2 support tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The XRP/USDT pair could then plunge to the $1.72 to $1.61 support zone.
BNB (BNB) has been trading just below the downtrend line, indicating that the bulls have held on to their positions as they anticipate a breakout.
If buyers propel the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $644. Sellers will try to defend the $644 resistance, but the bulls are expected to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA ($588). If that happens, the likelihood of a rally to $680 increases.
This optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down from the downtrend line and breaks below $566. That could keep the pair stuck inside the triangle for some more time.
Solana (SOL) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($126) on April 16 and rose above the 50-day SMA ($130), indicating buying on dips.
The SOL/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $153, where the bears are expected to mount a stiff resistance. If buyers pierce the $153 level, the pair could surge toward $180.
Buyers are expected to guard the zone between the 20-day EMA and $120. If the zone gives way, it suggests that the bears are active at higher levels. The pair could then descend to the $110 support.
Dogecoin (DOGE) has been trading between the 20-day EMA ($0.16) and the crucial support at $0.14 for the past few days.
The flattening 20-day EMA and the positive divergence on the RSI suggest reduced selling pressure. Buyers will have to drive the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.17) to gain the upper hand. The DOGE/USDT pair could climb to $0.20, an essential level to watch out for as a break above it completes a double bottom pattern.
Contrarily, a break and close below the $0.14 support signals the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The pair could then plummet to $0.10.
Buyers have kept Cardano (ADA) above the $0.59 support but are struggling to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.63).
If the price turns down and breaks below $0.59, the ADA/USDT pair could slide toward the solid support at $0.50. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it signals the resumption of the downtrend. The next support on the downside is at $0.40.
Buyers will be back in the driver’s seat on a break and close above the 50-day SMA ($0.70). The pair could then rally to $0.83.

UNUS SED LEO’s (LEO) failure to rise above the uptrend line may have tempted short-term buyers to book profits.
The 20-day EMA ($9.34) has started to turn down gradually, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling a slight edge to the bears. If the price tumbles below the immediate support at $8.95, the LEO/USD pair could retest the vital level at $8.79. A break below $8.79 could sink the pair to $8.30.
This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price rises above the 50-day SMA ($9.56). The pair could then retest the stiff overhead resistance at $9.90. 
Chainlink (LINK) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($12.77), but the bears have failed to pull the price below $11.68, signaling a lack of sellers at lower levels.
The bulls will try to push the price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $16. Sellers will try to halt the rally at $16, but the pair could reach the resistance line if the bulls prevail.
If sellers want to retain the advantage, they will have to sink the price below the $11.68 support. The pair could then decline to the support line of the descending channel, which is likely to attract buyers.
Avalanche (AVAX) has been trading near the moving averages, indicating a balance between supply and demand.
The flattish 20-day EMA ($18.97) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. A break above the downtrend line could open the doors for a rally to the overhead resistance at $23.50. Buyers will have to overcome this barrier to start a new up move.
On the downside, a break and close below $17.50 may sink the AVAX/USDT pair to $15.27. This is an essential level for the bulls to defend, as a break below $15.27 may signal the resumption of the downtrend.

Elsewhere, Coinbase’s report for institutional investors added to concerns by highlighting that cryptocurrencies may be in a bear market until a recovery occurs in the third quarter of 2025.
Mantra’s recent token collapse highlights an issue within the crypto industry of fluctuating weekend liquidity levels creating additional downside volatility, which may have exacerbated the token’s crash.

A monthly market review by publicly traded US-based crypto exchange Coinbase shows that while the crypto market has contracted, it appears to be gearing up for a better quarter.
According to Coinbase’s April 15 monthly outlook for institutional investors, the altcoin market cap shrank by 41% from its December 2024 highs of $1.6 trillion to $950 billion by mid-April. BTC Tools data shows that this metric touched a low of $906.9 billion on April 9 and stood at $976.9 billion at the time of writing.
Venture capital funding to crypto projects has reportedly decreased by 50%–60% from 2021–22. In the report, Coinbase’s global head of research, David Duong, highlighted that a new crypto winter may be upon us.
“Several converging signals may be pointing to the start of a new ‘crypto winter’ as some extreme negative sentiment has set in due to the onset of global tariffs and the potential for further escalations,” he said.

Manta Network co-founder Kenny Li said he was targeted by a sophisticated phishing attack on Zoom that used live recordings of familiar people in an attempt to lure him to download malware. 
The meeting seemed real with the impersonated person’s camera on, but the lack of sound and a suspicious prompt to download a script raised red flags, Li said in an April 17 X post.
“I could see their legit faces. Everything looked very real. But I couldn’t hear them. It said my Zoom needs an update. But it asked me to download a script file. I immediately left.”
Li then asked the impersonator to verify themselves over a Telegram call, however, they didn’t comply and proceeded to erase all messages and block him soon after.
Li said the North Korean state-backed Lazarus Group was behind the attack.
The Manta Network co-founder managed to screenshot his conversation with the attacker before the messages were deleted, during which Li initially suggested moving the call over to Google Meet.
Speaking with Cointelegraph, Li said he believed the live shots used in the video call were taken from past recordings of real team members.
“It didn’t seem AI-generated. The quality looked like what a typical webcam quality looks like.”

The cryptocurrency market is still recycling old narratives, with few new trends yet to emerge and replace the leading themes in the first quarter of 2025.
Artificial intelligence tokens and memecoins were the dominant crypto narratives in the first quarter of 2025, accounting for 62.8% of investor interest, according to a quarterly research report by CoinGecko. AI tokens captured 35.7% of global investor interest, overtaking the 27.1% share of memecoins, which remained in second place.
Out of the top 20 crypto narratives of the quarter, six were memecoin categories while five were AI-related.
“Seems like we have yet to see another new narrative emerge and we are still following past quarters’ trends,” said Bobby Ong, the co-founder and chief operating officer of CoinGecko, in an April 17 X post. “I guess we are all tired from the same old trends repeating themselves.”

The crypto lending market’s size remains significantly down from its $64 billion high, but decentralized finance (DeFi) borrowing has made a more than 900% recovery from bear market lows.
Crypto lending enables borrowers to use their crypto holdings as collateral to obtain crypto or fiat loans, while lenders can use their holdings to generate interest.
The crypto lending market was down over 43%, from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021 to $36.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a Galaxy Digital research report published on April 14.
“The decline can be attributed to the decimation of lenders on the supply side and funds, individuals, and corporate entities on the demand side,” according to Zack Pokorny, research associate at Galaxy Digital.
The decline in the crypto lending market started in 2022 when centralized finance (CeFi) lenders Genesis, Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager filed for bankruptcy within two years as crypto valuations fell.
Their collective downfall led to an estimated 78% collapse in the size of the lending market, with CeFi lending losing 82% of its open borrows, according to the report.

5b9b96cd914f8dfd39244e55f5f2ff33,Cointelegraph,Analysts brace for Bitcoin slide on gloomy US manufacturing data,https://cointelegraph.com/news/analysts-brace-bitcoin-slide-us-manufacturing-data," The Federal Reserve's monthly manufacturing survey showed the sharpest decline in activity since 2020. 
Bitcoin’s spot price could take a hit after the US Federal Reserve reported some of the worst manufacturing data in recent history, according to several cryptocurrency analysts.
On April 17, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Manufacturing Index — a monthly survey of 250 US-based manufacturers — reported the sharpest declines in overall business activity since 2020. 
The data puts Bitcoin (BTC) “under short term pressure,” researchers at Bitunix, a crypto exchange, said in a post on the X platform. They added that Bitcoin could still see a “strong comeback” if its price holds above $83,000 per coin.  
As of April 18, Bitcoin has been trading at approximately $84,000 per coin, according to data from Google Finance. The Federal Reserve’s bearish report comes as factories brace for the impact of US President Donald Trump’s plans to impose sweeping tariffs on US imports, potentially raising production costs for manufacturers. 
“[I]ndicators for general activity, new orders, and shipments all fell and turned negative… suggest[ing] subdued expectations for growth over the next six months,” the report said.

Analysts said the combination of rising prices and slowing production could deal a blow to financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Rising prices limit central banks’ ability to support markets in a downturn. 
“Economic activity is falling off a cliff and any activity that remains, the prices are going up,” Felix Jauvin, a Blockworks macroeconomic analyst, said in a post on the X platform. 
It's an “[a]bsolute worst scenario for policy makers here especially with no meaningful idea of how permanent tariffs will be,” he added.
However, Bitcoin has been more resilient to recent macroeconomic shocks than stocks or other cryptocurrencies, Binance said in an April research report. 
Since Trump announced his tariff plans on April 2, Bitcoin has traded roughly flat after initially declining but more than 10%, Google Finance data shows. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 — an index of US stocks — is still down by around 7%. 
“Even in the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” Binance said. 
Trump initially sought to impose double-digit levies on virtually all foreign goods but later paused planned tariffs on certain countries. 
He still wants to place high taxes on many Chinese imports, causing concerns among crypto executives who fear a trade war could harm blockchain networks.

82eb00d24ed67a759ae76e50601ece5f,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin whales absorb 300% of newly mined BTC supply — Is $100K next?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whales-absorb-300-newly-mined-btc-supply," A BTC price technical breakout is underway that could send Bitcoin toward $100,000 by May. 
Bitcoin’s (BTC) richest traders and investors are increasingly bullish on BTC despite facing downside risks from unfavorable macroeconomic factors, the latest onchain data suggests. 
Bitcoin whales and sharks are now absorbing BTC at record rates—over 300% of yearly issuance—while exchanges are losing coins at a historic pace, according to Glassnode.
Notably, Bitcoin’s yearly absorption rate by exchanges has plunged below -200% as outflows continue. This signals a growing preference for self-custody or long-term investment.
Meanwhile, larger holders (100–1,000+ BTC) are scooping up more than three times the new issuance, marking the fastest rate of accumulation among sharks and whales in Bitcoin’s history. 
This marks a structural shift as traditional finance increasingly adopts BTC, particularly with the approval spot Bitcoin ETFs last year. The result is less BTC supply on crypto exchanges and long-term bullish conviction among big holders.
Bitcoin whales holding over 10,000 BTC remain in strong accumulation territory, with their Trend Accumulation Score at around 0.7 as of April 18, according to Glassnode.
This metric quantifies cohort behavior from distribution (0) to accumulation (1). The score implies confidence among the largest holders of Bitcoin.
In contrast, the sell-off in smaller cohorts that have been distributing earlier in the year appears to be slowing down. That includes the 10–100 BTC and the 1-100 BTC groups, whose scores have climbed back to a neutral zone at around 0.5.
Even the smallest cohort (
Onchain analyst Mignolet adds that the whale behavior is similar to what preceded Bitcoin’s 2020 bull run.
Bitcoin has broken out of a multimonth falling wedge pattern, signaling a potential bullish reversal that could drive its price toward the $100,000 mark by May.
A falling wedge forms when price action contracts between two downward-sloping trendlines and resolves with an upside breakout. Traders typically measure the wedge’s upside target by measuring its maximum height and adding the outcome to the breakout point. 
Applying this rule of technical analysis brings Bitcoin’s target to over $101,570.

Conversely, BTC’s price is testing its 50-day (the red wave) and 200-day (the blue wave) exponential moving averages (EMAs) around $85,300 as resistance. A bearish rejection from these EMAs risks pushing BTC’s price toward the wedge’s upper trendline near $80,000. 
“The 200-day moving average remains overhead as resistance, and the horizontal level at $88,804 is still the key barrier to flip market structure and print a higher high,” wrote market analyst Scott Melker, adding:
