946f57a0c744593fcee42153f8506cbf,Cointelegraph,Crypto banking rule withdrawal by Fed ‘not real progress’ — Senator Lummis,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-banking-guidance-united-states-federal-reserve-cynthia-lummis-doubts," Senator Cynthia Lummis' doubts about the Federal Reserve's recent decision come as many prominent crypto entrepreneurs have voiced their support. 
United States Senator Cynthia Lummis suggests the crypto industry may be celebrating too soon over the US Federal Reserve softening its crypto guidance for banks.
“The Fed withdrawing crypto guidance is just noise, not real progress,” Lummis said in an April 25 X post. Lummis called the Fed’s April 24 announcement — withdrawing its 2022 supervisory letter that had discouraged banks from engaging with crypto and stablecoin activities — “just lip service.”
Lummis, a pro-crypto advocate known for introducing the Bitcoin (BTC) Strategic Reserve Bill in July 2024, pointed out several flaws in the Fed’s announcement, even as Strategy founder Michael Saylor and crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano suggested it was a step forward for banks and crypto.
She argued that the Fed continues to “illegally flout the law on master accounts” and still relies on reputational risk in its bank supervision practices. It comes as the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC) is working on a rule to stop examiners from considering reputational risk when reviewing a bank’s operations, according to a recent Bloomberg report.
Lummis also highlighted the Fed’s policy statement in Section 9(13), which hasn’t been withdrawn, stating that Bitcoin and digital assets are considered “unsafe and unsound.”
She also reiterated many of the same staff behind Operation Chokepoint 2.0 are still involved in crypto policy today.
“I will continue to hold the Fed accountable until the digital asset industry gets more than a life jacket, Chair Powell — they need a fair shake,” Lummis said.

Custodia Bank founder and CEO Caitlin Long seemed to share a similar view to Lummis.
“THANK YOU for seeing this for what it is,” Long said.
However, many crypto executives praised the Fed’s announcement as a positive development for the industry. Saylor said in an April 25 X post that the Fed’s move means that “banks are now free to begin supporting Bitcoin.”
Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum, said the Fed’s decision “is a significant development, as it will simplify the path to institutional adoption.”

745f6ca47bd6948f497450ca39a56bf5,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin ETFs on $3B ‘bender,’ log first full week of inflows in 5 weeks",https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-consecutive-inflow-week-significant-inflows," ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out how quickly spot Bitcoin ETFs can go from “1st gear to 5th gear.” 
Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the United States saw over $3 billion in inflows this week, marking the first full week of consecutive inflows in five weeks.
On April 25, the 11 spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs saw $380 million in inflows, bringing the total for the week to around $3.06 billion over five consecutive inflow days, according to Farside data. The last time spot Bitcoin ETFs had a full week of inflow days was the trading week ending March 21.
ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in an April 24 X post that “ETFs are on a Bitcoin bender.”
“What’s really notable here is just HOW FAST the flows can go from 1st gear to 5th gear,” Balchunas said, forecasting that some of those flows may be due to the “basis trade back in effect.”
Amid ongoing financial and macroeconomic uncertainty, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a volatile April, with nine out of the total 18 trading days so far being outflow days. 
However, a strong surge of inflows over the past week has turned the month positive, bringing total net inflows for April to approximately $2.26 billion.
On the same day, Strategy founder Michael Saylor reportedly said at the Bitwise Invest Bitcoin Corporations Investor Day that BlackRock’s iShare Bitcoin ETF “will be “the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.”

Just two days prior, on April 23, BlackRock’s iShare Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) was awarded the “Best New ETF” at the annual etf.com ETF awards. IBIT was also the recipient of Crypto ETP of the year.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s spot price continues to hover around the $95,000 price level, currently trading at $94,613 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. Institutions are continuing to raise their bullish price targets.
Billion-dollar asset manager ARK Invest recently raised its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, driven largely by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as “digital gold.”
ARK’s “bear” and “base” case scenarios for the price of Bitcoin were also bumped up to $500,000 and $1.2 million.

318c5dd48b2582e679223ae21f660043,Cointelegraph,Bitcoiner Jack Mallers vows not to let Twenty One distract from Strike,https://cointelegraph.com/news/strike-ceo-jack-mallers-bitcoin-stance-commitment-twenty-one-capital," Strike CEO Jack Mallers reiterated his commitment to Strike, saying he expects “8-9 figures in net profit in 2025.” 
Strike CEO Jack Mallers said his new role as CEO of Bitcoin treasury firm Twenty One Capital won’t distract him from heading Strike, revealing the platform processed over $6 billion in volume in 2024.
“This is not a shift in my commitment; it’s an extension of it,” Mallers said in an April 25 letter to Strike investors.
“If Bitcoin wins, humanity wins. Every business decision I make starts with one question: Is this good for Bitcoin? Twenty One exists because I believe it is good for Bitcoin and, therefore, good for the world,” Mallers said.
Mallers explained that Strike, a Bitcoin payments platform, and Twenty One Capital have different goals. He said Strike focuses on making “Bitcoin accessible globally,” while Twenty One aims to increase “Bitcoin ownership per share (BPS) and pioneer Bitcoin-native financial tools.”
“These are separate companies, but they share the same ethos: Bitcoin wins, we win,” he said.
It comes after Twenty One Capital announced its launch on April 23, with the backing of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald. 
The firm is looking to challenge Michael Saylor’s Strategy to become the “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” It revealed its plans to launch with 42,000 Bitcoin (BTC).
Mallers shared key metrics for Strike publicly for the first time, revealing that in 2024, the firm posted over $6 billion in volume, recorded 600% year-on-year growth, maintained an 85% gross profit margin, and reported zero customer acquisition costs.
Mallers said that despite maintaining a team of 75 employees, the company expects to “generate 8-9 figures in net profit in 2025.”
Several crypto enthusiasts had taken to social media to ask how the logistics would work for Mallers, being the CEO of Strike and Twenty One Capital.
Related: 5 Bitcoin charts predicting BTC price rally toward $100K by May
Crypto commentator “Alex” asked in an April 25 X post, “What will be the fate of Strike? New incoming CEO? Or will he pull an Elon Musk?” Similarly, Domingo Guerra asked, “Who will be running Strike!?”
Meanwhile, several crypto industry participants have publicly speculated that Twenty One Capital may acquire Strike in the future. Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said it is “probably safe to assume that this company will acquire strike.” 
Daniel Sempere Pico said, “How long before Twenty One acquires Strike?” However, neither Mallers or Strike has indicated any intention of doing so.

d22da0d0d7f26df825bbde521f9627c6,Cointelegraph,"Price predictions 4/25: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, SUI, LINK, AVAX",https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-predictions-4-25-btc-eth-xrp-bnb-sol-doge-ada-sui-link-avax," Bitcoin price pushed above $95,000 as multiple bullish catalysts lead to a spike in spot trading volumes. 
Key points:
Bitcoin price pushed above $95,000, increasing the chance of a rally to $100,000.
Institutional investor demand is back, suggesting that the bearish trend could be over.
Select altcoins could break above their respective overhead resistance levels if Bitcoin remains strong
Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are trying to sustain the price above $95,000, but they are likely to face significant resistance from the bears. Will buyers succeed in pushing the price toward the psychologically important level of $100,000, or is a pullback around the corner? That is the big question on the traders’ minds.
A positive sign is that inflows for US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have increased since April 21, per Farside Investors data. Coinbase Institutional head of strategy John D’Agostino said in a recent interview with CNBC that several institutions purchased Bitcoin in April to hedge against currency inflation and macro uncertainty as Bitcoin mirrors “the characteristics of gold.
However, some analysts doubt the sustainability of the current Bitcoin rally. One of the red flags is that the sentiment, as measured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, slipped from a score of 72 out of 100 on April 23 to 60 on April 25, though Bitcoin is trading close to $95,000. Select analysts expect Bitcoin to pullback toward $87,000. 
Could Bitcoin sustain above $95,000, triggering buying in altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
Bitcoin has been trading near the $95,000 level, suggesting that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate a move higher.
The 20-day exponential moving average ($87,437) is sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the overbought zone, signaling that the bulls are in command. A close above $95,000 could drive the BTC/USDT pair to $100,000. 
Sellers will try to halt the up move at $100,000, but if the bulls do not allow the price to dip below $95,000, the prospects of a break above the overhead resistance increase. The pair may then climb to $107,000. The bears will have to yank the price below the moving averages to regain control.
Ether’s (ETH) relief rally is facing resistance at the 50-day SMA ($1,812), but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($1,696).
The 20-day EMA is flattish, but the RSI has jumped into the positive zone, signaling a slight advantage to the bulls. If the 50-day SMA is scaled, the ETH/USDT pair could reach the breakdown level of $2,111. The bears may pose a strong challenge at $2,111, but if the bulls overcome it, the pair could skyrocket to $2,550.
Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If they can pull it off, the pair could tumble toward $1,537.
XRP (XRP) has been trading near the 50-day SMA ($2.18) for the past two days, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level.
A minor positive for the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to skid below the 20-day EMA ($2.13). The bulls will again try to propel the XRP/USDT pair to the resistance line, which is a critical level to watch out for. The pair could rally to $3 if buyers pierce the resistance line.
On the downside, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bears remain in charge. The downside momentum could pick up on a break below $2. The pair may then plummet to $1.60.
BNB (BNB) turned down from $620 but is taking support at the moving averages. This suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.
Buyers will try to push the price above $620. If they manage to do that, the BNB/USDT pair may rally to $644. Sellers will try to stall the up move at the $644 level, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could soar to $680.
This bullish view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. That could sink the pair to $566, indicating that the markets have rejected the breakout above the downtrend line.
Solana (SOL) is struggling to stay above the $153 level, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.
The upsloping 20-day EMA ($136) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate that the bulls are in control. If buyers push and maintain the price above $153, the SOL/USDT pair could jump to $180.
The moving averages are the crucial support on the downside. A break and close below the 50-day SMA ($129) suggests that the pair could consolidate between $153 and $110 for a few days.
Dogecoin (DOGE) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.16) on April 24, indicating that the bulls are buying on dips.
The DOGE/USDT pair could reach $0.21, which is a crucial resistance to watch out for. If buyers pierce the $0.21 level, the pair will complete a double-bottom pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective of $0.28.
Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, the pair may remain range-bound between $0.21 and $0.14 for a while. The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears on a break below the $0.14 support.
Cardano (ADA) closed above the 50-day SMA ($0.68) on April 23, signaling that the bears are losing their grip.
The 20-day EMA ($0.65) has started to turn up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside. The ADA/USDT pair could rally to $0.83, where the bears may step in.
Any pullback is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it signals a bullish sentiment. Sellers will have to drag the price below the 20-day EMA to sink the pair to $0.58.
Related: SUI's 73% weekly price gains top crypto market — New price record in reach?
Sui (SUI) picked up momentum after buyers pushed the price above the moving averages on April 22.
The rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI into the overbought territory, suggesting a minor consolidation or correction in the next few days. Any pullback is expected to find support in the zone between the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $3.14 and the 50% retracement of $2.94.
A shallow pullback increases the possibility of a rally to $4.25 and then to $5. Sellers will be back in the driver’s seat if they pull the SUI/USDT pair below $2.86.
Chainlink (LINK) has started a recovery, which is expected to face strong selling at the overhead resistance of $16.
If the price turns down from $16, it is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA ($13.53). A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA increases the likelihood of a break above $16. The LINK/USDT pair may then climb to the resistance line of the descending channel pattern. A break above the channel signals a potential trend change.
Sellers will have to tug the price below the moving averages to regain control. The pair may then drop to $11.89 and eventually to the support line.
Avalanche (AVAX) is facing resistance at the overhead resistance of $23.50, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.
The 20-day EMA ($20.22) has started to turn up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that buyers have the edge. If the price breaks and closes above $23.50, the AVAX/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern. That could open the doors for a rally to the pattern target of $31.73.
Alternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, the pair could remain stuck inside the $23.50 to $15.27 range for a few days.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

9891b1d7ed61db3b258a8d45930f63b8,Cointelegraph,Semler Scientific buys another $10M worth of BTC,https://cointelegraph.com/news/semler-scientific-buys-another-10-million-bitcoin," The healthcare company increased its Bitcoin yield by 23.5% year-to-date, indicating a higher ratio of BTC per outstanding share. 
Semler Scientific has bought approximately $10 million worth of Bitcoin since Feb. 14, the healthcare technology company said in an April 25 statement. 
The company purchased 111 Bitcoin (BTC) for $10 million at an average price of roughly $90,000 per coin, Semler said. It holds a total of more than 3,300 Bitcoin worth approximately $300 million in aggregate. 
Semler said its Bitcoin purchases have earned stockholders a Bitcoin yield of 23.5% in the year to date. Bitcoin yield measures the ratio of BTC holdings to outstanding shares, reflecting growing exposure per share for investors. 
“Semler Scientific uses BTC Yield as a [key performance indicator] to help assess the performance of its strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner Semler Scientific believes is accretive to stockholders,” it said. 
The company said it acquired its Bitcoin treasury for an average price of nearly $89,000. As of April 25, Bitcoin trades at approximately $95,000 per coin, according to data from Cointelegraph. 
Semler Scientific is a healthcare technology company that develops and sells medical diagnostic products, with a primary focus on detecting chronic diseases. The company has partially financed its Bitcoin purchases by issuing roughly $125 million in new stock, it said. Semler also announced plans to raise $75 million through the private offering of convertible senior notes in January.

In 2024, Bitcoin’s surging price pushed Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) up more than 350%, according to data from FinanceCharts. Strategy’s success has inspired dozens of other companies, such as Semler, to start accumulating Bitcoin treasuries. 
Public companies are now among the largest institutional Bitcoin holders. As of April 25, corporate Bitcoin holdings are worth approximately $71 billion in the aggregate, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET.
Strategy is still the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with a treasury worth more than $50 billion. During the week of April 14, Strategy bagged 6,556 Bitcoin for an average price of $84,785 per coin.
Among institutional buyers, corporate treasuries still lag exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which cumulatively hold approximately $110 billion in Bitcoin as of April 25, according to Coinglass data.

179ba02d655567565b01dff47570790b,Cointelegraph,Crypto firms launch Wall Street-style funds: Finance Redefined,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-firms-launch-wall-street-funds-finance-redefined," Crypto firms are entering Wall Street with stocks and equities offerings, showing the “growing synergy” of the traditional investment and digital assets sectors. 
Cryptocurrency firms and centralized exchanges are launching more traditional investment offerings, bridging the divide between traditional financial and digital assets.
With investors seeking more flexible product offerings under one platform, the “line is blurring” between traditional finance (TradFi) and the cryptocurrency space, as the two financial paradigms signal a “growing synergy,” according to Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, the world’s sixth-largest crypto exchange.
In the wider crypto space, Securitize partnered with Mantle protocol to launch an institutional fund that will generate yield on a basket of diverse cryptocurrencies, similar to how traditional index funds track a mix of stocks.
The developments come after crypto investor sentiment staged a significant recovery, moving from “fear” to “neutral” for the first time since January 2025.
Investor sentiment was bolstered after US President Donald Trump said that import tariffs on Chinese goods will “come down substantially,” adopting a softer tone in negotiations for the first time since the reciprocal tariff announcement.
Cryptocurrency firms and exchanges are increasingly moving into Wall Street territory, launching more traditional investment offerings and showcasing the increasing connection between crypto and traditional finance (TradFi).
“There’s a growing synergy between traditional financial investments and the emerging crypto space,” according to Gracy Chen, the CEO of Bitget, the world’s sixth-largest crypto exchange.
“Crypto players are now checking out traditional finance as they see the opportunity to bridge it,” Chen told Cointelegraph.
“The lines are blurring. Investors want flexibility, and products that can straddle both worlds are naturally attractive,” Chen said. “Some players see TradFi as a safety net; others, like Bitget, see it as a launchpad for broader adoption.” She added:

Tokenization platform Securitize partnered with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Mantle to launch an institutional fund designed to earn yield on a diverse basket of cryptocurrencies, the companies said. 
Similar to how a traditional index fund tracks a mix of stocks, the Mantle Index Four (MI4) Fund aims to offer investors exposure to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL), as well as stablecoins tracking the US dollar, Securitize said in an April 24 announcement. 
The fund also integrates liquid staking tokens — including Mantle’s mETH, Bybit’s bbSOL, and Ethena’s USDe — in a bid to enhance returns with onchain yield, according to the announcement.
The launch comes as retail and institutions alike increase exposure to cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a hedge amid escalating macroeconomic uncertainty.

Mantra founder and CEO John Patrick Mullin has started unstaking 150 million of his Mantra (OM) tokens in preparation for sending them to a burn address in an attempt to restore the token’s value by tightening supply. 
Mantra announced on April 21 that the unstaking process had begun, and would be completed by April 29, at which point Mullin's Mantra (OM) tokens will be sent to the burn address and permanently removed from circulating supply.
Mullin said it was a “first step in rebuilding trust with the community, but far from the last.” 
Mantra said it was also in talks with “key ecosystem partners” about burning a further 150 million OM to bring the total burn amount to 300 million.
With 150 million fewer OM, Mantra’s total supply will decline to 1.67 billion, and its number of staked tokens will drop by over 26% to 421.8 million OM from 571.8 million OM.

Cryptocurrency staking protocol Symbiotic closed a $29 million Series A funding round led by Web3-focused investment firms, including Pantera Capital and Coinbase Ventures, to support the launch of a new economic coordination layer for blockchain security.
The round included more than 100 angel investors, with participation by major industry players Aave, Polygon and StarkWare, the company said in an April 23 announcement shared with Cointelegraph.
The closing of the funding round also marks the launch of Symbiotic’s Universal Staking Framework, which aims to be an economic coordination layer that bolsters blockchain security via staking.
The new staking layer enables the use of any combination of cryptocurrencies to secure networks, including monolithic and modular layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains, the announcement said.
“We’ve created a modular framework that lets protocols evolve security models over time while efficiently coordinating risk,” Misha Putiatin, co-founder of Symbiotic, told Cointelegraph. “This empowers protocols at every stage of their lifecycle to evolve their security models seamlessly without rebuilding infrastructure.”

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed a decision on whether to approve a proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) holding Polkadot’s native token, regulatory filings show. 
According to an April 24 filing, the regulator has extended its deadline for a final ruling until June 11, nearly four months after the Nasdaq sought permission to list Grayscale Polkadot Trust on Feb. 24.
Grayscale’s ETF filing adds to a roster of about 70 proposed ETFs awaiting SEC approval, including funds holding altcoins, memecoins and crypto-related financial derivatives, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  
Asset managers are pitching ETFs for “[e]verything from XRP, Litecoin and Solana to Penguins, Doge and 2x Melania and everything in between,” Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said in an April 21 post on the X platform. Asset manager 21Shares is also awaiting permission to list its own Polkadot ETF.

fd276e3227cfbb38dd08047e95fed687,Cointelegraph,"If Trump fired Powell, what would happen to crypto?",https://cointelegraph.com/news/if-trump-fired-powell-what-would-happen-to-crypto," A presidential assault on the Fed’s independence would send crypto into uncharted waters — and possibly vindicate its original thesis. 
Recent months have seen the ebb and flow of a certain pattern: US President Donald Trump will take some objectively harmful action to the US economy, and the markets will crash. Seeing this, Trump has turned to Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, and now demands he lower the Fed Funds Rate — the rate at which the Fed lends money to banks. And the steely eyed Powell will say “No.”
Trump wants to lower rates because doing so is an effective cash injection into the United States economy, stimulating activity and lifting the market. This, he believes, will make him appear successful. Powell wants to follow rigorous economic standards to set rates to carefully balance the Fed’s dual mandates of maximizing employment and maintaining stable prices. 
He also wants to maintain the Fed’s independence from political pressure and, crucially, maintain the Fed’s appearance of independence from political pressure. If the markets believe that the central bank’s independence has failed in the US, it may become more difficult to sell US Treasury Bills, the United States’ sovereign debt. That is a problem in the fundamental sense that the US will have to pay more to borrow money, making it poorer — but it is an especially acute problem now because the US already has an enormous, $30-trillion pile of debt which it has to periodically refinance.
If it is forced to refinance at higher rates because markets do not trust the US government anymore, then an ever greater percentage of GDP will be absorbed by the cost of interest, and, as the kids say, the United States will be cooked. 
That dance takes us to now. Last week, Trump repeatedly intimated that he would like to fire Powell, and the market didn’t like it. On Monday, Trump provoked a crash by calling Powell a “major loser” on Truth Social. In response, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly voiced concerns with the risks of firing Powell to Trump, who seems, for now, to have acquiesced, stating Tuesday that he would not fire his Fed chair. 
Still, this process feels more like a spiral than anything else, and many market watchers are waiting for the next shoe to drop. That forces the question: if Trump does go through with his base instincts and axes Powell, what will be the result? In particular, what effect will this have on the cryptocurrency industry?
It bears mentioning that the President is not supposed to be able to fire the Fed chair at will. Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 states that “each member shall hold office for a term of fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless sooner removed for cause by the President.”
This language may appear ambiguous, but in the 1935 case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution does not give the President an “illimitable power of removal” and so the President’s removal power is limited by statutory language. 
This decision ratified the concept of “independent agencies,” which reside within the executive branch, but have independent authority. While a number of agencies have this characteristic, including the SEC, the CFTC, and the FTC, the Fed is the most important.

Economists do not think much about the political control of central banks. Politicians have relatively short-term incentives, thinking in years or election cycles. This inherently pushes them to prefer short-termist policies, of which hot cash injections are the purest form. However, fiscal and monetary policy are delicate arts that often animate painful policy choices. 
In a classic example, Richard Nixon pressured then-Fed chair Arthur Burns to pursue expansionary monetary policy in the lead up to the 1972 election, believing that it would help his reelection odds. Nixon won that election in a landslide, but soon followed catastrophic “stagflation” that crippled the United States economy for a decade, and indeed may still be felt in the industries which hollowed out during that period. 
Contrast this with the policies of Paul Volcker, who, after this devastating period of stagflation, implemented a vicious series of rate increases between 1979 and 1987, which caused the “Volcker Shocks”, a series of painful recessions. However, the effect of this policy was to eventually strangle inflation and herald in the boom times of the 90s, facilitating Bill Clinton’s remarkable fiscal policy. 
No politician could have made these choices, none will in the future, and that is the rub. Economists — and, crucially, markets — believe deeply that the Fed must remain independent or else the entire economic fabric of American society risks collapse. This is no hyperbole — nations with politically controlled central banks like Weimar Germany, Peronist Argentina and Venezuela have experienced such crippling hyperinflation that it led variously to multigenerational geopolitical backsliding, reports of citizens starving and eating rats, and the rise of Adolph Hitler. This is serious stuff.
To fire Powell, Trump will first have to defeat the Humphrey's Executor precedent, a prospect that many legal scholars believe likely in light of the current Supreme Court composition. This is a Rubicon which, once crossed, marks a point of no return. Not just Trump, but every President who follows will have plenary legal authority to direct all executive officers — Fed Chair included — at their will. Most believe this will lead to ruin. 
But disaster or no, it will be a test for cryptocurrency. The original Bitcoin White Paper aimed to disintermediate financial transactions from “financial institutions serving as trusted third parties.” If the Fed falls, and US monetary policy is unmoored from sound judgment, the thesis of cryptocurrency’s early years will be put in stark relief. 
As Trump has provoked capital flight in recent weeks, investors have sought safety in various assets. Traditionally, any time there was a crisis, sophisticated parties fled risk assets into US Treasurys. The thinking was that these were riskless assets. Well, those days may be done. Ten year bond yields approached 5% during the peak of the Tariff Crisis and have not yet fully returned to previous lows. If Trump breaks the Fed, these outflows will be a drop in a bucket in a river, and that money may move into cryptocurrencies. 
Historically, the price of Bitcoin has tightly tracked the Nasdaq (albeit with a multiplier). However, since the Tariff Crisis, while US securities prices have remained largely depressed, Bitcoin has miraculously begun to pump. This has led some to speculate that we are witnessing the long-prophesied “decoupling”, wherein crypto-assets will fulfill their original purpose and move independently from centralized assets. 
It is impossible to say if this will or will not happen, but if Trump gives Powell the boot, we will find out for sure. 
Of course, world-historical collapse can’t be all good for crypto, and there will be significant pain across a variety of surfaces from this crisis as well. In the first instance, stablecoins will feel dire consequences almost immediately. 
In the last decade, two USD-denominated stablecoins — USDC and USDT — have dominated the market. Their issuers, Circle and Tether, are both important systemic institutions and major buyers of US Treasurys, which collateralize the majority of their stablecoin obligations. 
An immediate result of a Fed Crisis could be a Treasury default. The economist Noah Smith has speculated that Trump might try to write down the US’s sovereign debt:
“I suspect Trump will do something more like what he used to do as a businessman when his debt went bad — look for a cheap bailout, and if one doesn’t emerge, declare bankruptcy.”
Indeed, the President has hinted darkly at this prospect himself, in February suggesting that they might rely on pretense to mark the bills down:
""There could be a problem - you've been reading about that, with Treasuries and that could be an interesting problem…It could be that a lot of those things don't count. In other words, that some of that stuff that we're finding is very fraudulent, therefore maybe we have less debt than we thought.”

A sovereign default would immediately affect Circle and Tether by marking down the value of their collateral. This, in turn, could leave the stablecoins undercollateralized, which might provoke a bank run. The markets may ultimately stabilize, but events could easily turn the other way, leading to collapse of major stablecoins. 
This in turn would have numerous second-order effects, as smart contracts holding stables as collateral began liquidating positions, and contagion swept the rest of the market. 
Interestingly, these mechanical consequences may be less dire than the political costs of a Fed Crisis, because treasuries are not the only asset that has systemic importance to crypto. The US dollar has been the world's reserve currency for many, many years. There are lots of good reasons for this; it is relatively strong and stable, so it is good to settle trade with. But if the government backing it ceases to be strong and stable, this paradigm will likely shift. 
And as more trade is executed in euro or yuan-denominated accounts, regulators in the EU and China will, in turn, have much more control of the flows of fiat currency through cryptocurrency. One prominent cryptocurrency attorney, who chose not to be named for fear of political reprisal, speculated exactly this:
“​​I think China will fill a lot of the void and EU will fill most of the rest. Neither would be good for crypto generally between CCP and EU over-regulating in different ways for different goals. This seems bad.”
This might prompt flight to uncollateralized crypto-primitive assets, but there is essentially no precedent for such assets being used at scale for real-world transactions. It is just as likely that a stablecoin crisis could simply kneecap the industry for years as it is catching its stride.
Ultimately, nobody knows whether Trump will fire Powell, or even if he can. Nobody knows what consequences might flow downstream from his decisions. But if a butterfly flapping its wings in Argentina can cause a tornado in Prague, then Donald Trump muttering incantations in the West Wing might vindicate or destabilize the blockchain forever.
Like it or not, we’re all along for the ride.

8c0a9b14ed006a1563e5f88e7dc8ed55,Cointelegraph,Ethical finance must guide crypto’s evolution,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethical-finance-must-guide-crypto-s-evolution," As crypto’s speculative fervor wanes, it’s time for the industry to rediscover its roots in ethical finance. Ethical finance principles can steer the crypto industry toward meaningful innovation. 
Opinion by: Daniel Ahmed, co-founder of Fasset and founding member of the Own Foundation
Crypto was born from a vision to decentralize power, democratize finance and build systems where equity prevails over exploitation. Somewhere along the way, however, the movement lost its moral compass. As speculation surged, purpose dwindled.
We must return crypto to its decentralized roots, a technological revolution built on long-term value, inclusivity and ethics rather than cyclical, speculative gains. The industry should take inspiration from emerging regions and how ethical financial investing can help to repair some of the ways our industry has often fallen short. 
When Vitalik wrote a blog post on layer 2s as a cultural extension of Ethereum, he brought up a critical point not only in business and technology but humanity — what we build in this life should be more significant than ourselves. Citing blockchains, he described how layer 2s, which he framed as subcultures of Ethereum, don’t merely differ in their technical benefits but how their positioning and intricacies trickle down into the culture of their communities. 
In a space where new layer 2s are emerging rapidly, Vitalik’s insights are accurate and inspiring. When we build in a vacuum of echo chambers and monocultures, we miss out on the actual value of community in Web3. 
What really brings communities together? Too often in crypto, that answer has been making people rich. What it should be is shared ideals that solve real issues. If done with purpose and conviction, this can still make people money. 
While the rapid rise of layer 2 and layer 3 solutions promises scalability and efficiency, they are too often motivated by speculative gains rather than lasting value creation. If there’s any doubt, the numbers speak for themselves. 
Layer-2 fatigue aside, the sheer scope of this data raises the question: Is our industry innovating just because it can, or is it creating a real-world utility that improves the lives of fellow humans? There’s nothing wrong with building something to make money, but if that’s the only reason we’re building something, that’s a problem.

We need to shift the narrative and look at how Web3 is solving actual, fundamental issues in emerging markets — particularly in regions like the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa — as a north star for how to ethically build the future of our space. 
If crypto projects think innovation in Web3 is only about VC-led fundraising rounds, comparing transactions per second, or building the next great decentralized application to trade cat coins, they have probably never existed in a place where even the simplest of financial transactions is cumbersome. 
In emerging markets, where people grapple with inflation, high remittance fees and limited access to financial services, we’ve witnessed how meaningful effects can transform the daily lives of millions. These are not abstract issues. They affect business owners, families, students, creators and more. 
From stablecoins to secure and user-friendly payment applications, Web3 offers a unique opportunity to address these problems by creating decentralized financial systems that bypass the inefficiencies and inequities of traditional banking. For Web3 to truly make a difference in these regions, it must be designed with a focus on ethics, accessibility and long-term utility. We must lead by example. 
In these markets, if innovation doesn’t create a meaningful disruption that improves people’s lives and addresses real-world problems, it’s nothing more than a buzzword. The most powerful solutions in technology are those that solve the world’s greatest problems.
If you want inspiration, pay attention to those doing something different. If you want to inspire others, lead by example. 
Ethical finance, particularly Islamic finance, offers valuable lessons for Web3. Dating back to the 1960s and 70s in the Middle East and North Africa (and even further to around 620 AD), this sector is built on risk-sharing, ethical investment and a focus on tangible assets. 
Islamic finance has endured for centuries because it rejects speculation in favor of real, meaningful value. For example, we’ve seen the rise of ethical finance institutions like Al Rajhi Bank, one of the most prominent Islamic banks globally, known for its investments in tangible assets and community-oriented financial products. 
This model, which strives to build based on morals, substance and necessity versus mere financial opportunity, can guide Web3 as it moves beyond hype-driven growth.
As we look toward the next few years with the wind and a bull market beneath our wings, the time has come for Web3 to take a hard look in the mirror and redefine what success and innovation genuinely look like. The answer to this won’t be the same for everyone — that would be pretty boring if it were. 
We must find a common ground of shared values that extends beyond technical achievements, market capitalization, total value locked or X followers but strives to innovate something more significant than any layer 2 or token. 
When gearing up to launch something new, our industry must ask itself something that lives at the heart of Islamic finance: How will this product improve people’s lives? Is it true to the ethos of creating decentralized systems that are transparent, fair and built for the benefit of all?
If we can’t answer that, perhaps we should step back and ask why. Then, get back to work.

 The speed and severity of a flash crash can often be hard to understand. For the average investor, it sparks terror and perhaps confirms their deepest fears of their crypto stash becoming worthless. But with a calm head, the “tripwire” for a BTC crash is usually tied to a certain combination of interconnected factors. Let’s take a look at how flash crashes happen:Liquidation of leveraged positions when markets move unexpectedly. If leveraged traders can’t maintain their collateral during a big market drop, exchanges automatically sell their position to pay off the loan. When this happens on a large scale, it sends a wave of selling pressure through the market, crashing prices along the way.Algorithmic trading errors can cause a cascade of sell orders. Many traders use computer programs with preset rules. When these systems react to unusual market conditions, the trading bots can start selling aggressively. This then has a knock-on effect, sending sell signals and causing a chain reaction of automatic selling. Low market liquidity makes prices more sensitive to large trades. Think of this as far more active sellers than buyers. For BTC, it’s more prevalent on smaller exchanges where someone wants to sell a large amount quickly. They exhaust the available buy order immediately and cause a sudden BTC drop.Technical glitches in exchange infrastructure can cause trading to break down. It could be from servers going offline, data feeds freezing or order matching failing. This can lead to incorrect pricing displays and orders executing at extreme prices. Panic selling regularly occurs during scary news events. As the old trader’s saying goes, “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” When bad news breaks, markets could panic and everyone sells simultaneously, overwhelming buyers and sending prices plummeting.Did you know? In December 2024, BTC finally breached the elusive $100,000 mark but then tumbled back down to $94,000 within hours. In the process, over 200,000 traders were liquidated, causing losses of over $1 billion.

 The unfurling of a crypto market crash sends an icy stab through most investors’ bodies; of course, they are highly unfavorable market conditions in most scenarios. But once you’ve gotten over the initial shock, there can be some hidden benefits to explore. Exceptional buying conditions: While destructive for panicked investors, for those who are prepared, it offers a golden buying opportunity to buy BTC at a substantially discounted price. Market stress test: Assuming there is a quick recovery, these types of events serve as a stress test to get valuable insight into how markets react under extreme circumstances. Improved industry practices: It provides a learning opportunity for platforms like crypto exchanges to understand what went wrong and improve their infrastructure to avoid incidents in the future.Increased investor protection: Flash crashes attract the attention of mainstream media and regulators. This focus can be a catalyst for better regulation and protection for retail investors.Did you know? Despite its reputation for crashes and volatility, BTC now shows signs of becoming a mature asset. It can be less volatile than many well-known securities, such as the “Magnificent 7,” which includes Nvidia, Meta, Tesla and others.

 There have been several BTC flash crashes since the cryptocurrency was launched in 2009. Some of the biggest exchanges have seen prices evaporate in minutes, and market-wide crashes have left investors grappling with wiped-out portfolios. On June 19, 2011, the infamous Mt. Gox exchange was exposed to a database hack and compromised accounts. BTC’s price was pulverized from $17 down to $0.01, almost valueless. It was an early setback for Mt. Gox and BTC’s reputation, but it exposed early exchange vulnerability and showed the need for more robust infrastructure. More recently, on March 18, 2024, BTC flash crashed on BitMEX. While other exchanges were trading at over $60,000, the price on BitMEX crumbled down to $8,900. It all happened in just two minutes, but the recovery was swift, with prices rebounding to normal levels within 10 minutes. In addition, BTC-EUR prices on Coinbase briefly crashed from €63K to €48K, sharply diverging from other markets, as reported by Kaiko Research.CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Moreno, commented on the flash crash that saw Bitcoin briefly drop to around $88,800 on December 5, 2024. According to him, the flash crash was driven by a sell-off cascade and deleveraging in the BTC futures market, with open interest dropping as leveraged long positions were liquidated.COVID-19 was also responsible for a market-wide crash in March 2020 when the world’s most widely held crypto slid 50% in two days. The price collapsed from over $9,000 to below $4,000. It then took two months for market prices to return to previous levels.

 Flash crashes are almost impossible to accurately predict. When they strike, things happen quickly. Usually, the damage is done before a human can react, particularly when positions are liquidated and trading bots react to sell signals. But it is still possible to prepare and protect yourself against the fallout. Set up price alerts at key technical levels: This will help to alert you to unnatural market conditions so you are not caught off guard. Use leverage lightly; flash crashes burn highly leveraged traders instantly. So, don’t overexpose yourself to highly leveraged market positions.Learn to use a stop loss to protect capital. This enables you to sell your position early on in a crash, although they’re not foolproof, as a flash crash can fly past a stop loss in the worst cases. Keep spare capital in reserve to give you the ability to capitalize on low market prices when they arrive.Don’t keep the bulk of your holdings in an exchange account. Crashes can put platforms under severe financial stress, so try to self-custody your assets.As learned, flash crashes happen fast and can wipe out positions in seconds, especially for leveraged traders. Keeping a diversified portfolio, setting stop-loss orders and only investing what you can afford to lose are simple but effective ways to reduce risk during sudden market drops.
