Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

c52e2493c3e837f979287c565196d3b1,Cointelegraph,Over 13K institutions exposed to Strategy as Saylor hints at BTC buy,https://cointelegraph.com/news/13-000-institutions-exposure-strategy-saylor-hints-btc-buy," According to data from SaylorTracker, Strategy is up over 25% on its Bitcoin investment, amounting to over $9 billion in unrealized gains. 
Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at an impending Bitcoin (BTC) purchase by Strategy and said that more than 13,000 institutions now have direct exposure to the company.
The company's most recent acquisition of 3,459 BTC, valued at over $285 million at the time of purchase, on April 14, brought Strategy's total holdings to 531,644 BTC, valued at over $44.9 billion.
Saylor followed up on the BTC chart, which he typically posts on Sundays to signal an imminent BTC acquisition, with a breakdown of investor exposure to the company. The executive wrote in an April 20 X post:
Strategy's growing popularity among retail and institutional investors is significant due to the company siphoning capital from traditional financial markets and into Bitcoin. Increased capital flows translate into the company accumulating and holding more BTC, slowly increasing the price of the supply-capped digital asset.
Related: Has Michael Saylor’s Strategy built a house of cards?
Strategy issues corporate debt and equity to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions, giving holders indirect exposure to BTC and feeding capital from traditional financial markets into the Bitcoin market.
In December 2024, Strategy was added to the Nasdaq 100, a weighted stock market index that tracks the 100 largest companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq exchange.
The inclusion of Strategy in the Nasdaq 100 will draw in even more capital to BTC from passive investors holding the tech-focused index in their portfolios.
In February 2025, Bitcoin analyst Julian Fahrer reported that 12 US states had exposure to Strategy, including California, Florida, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, and Utah.
Bloomberg exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst Eric Balchunas recently said that inflows from Bitcoin ETFs and institutional inflows from companies like Strategy have shored up the Bitcoin market against dumping by short-term speculators.
The analyst added that Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $2.4 billion in capital flows year-to-date, helping to cushion the price of the digital asset.

bbe623cdb972fff11f07b5d4dd890187,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin prepares for launch from $85K, BNB, HYPE, TAO and RNDR could follow",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-prepares-for-launch-from-85-k-bnb-hype-tao-and-rndr-could-follow," Traders say Bitcoin holding the $85,000 level is bullish, and charts suggest BNB, HYPE, TAO and RNDR could be the first altcoins to follow a BTC price breakout. 
Bitcoin (BTC) has risen roughly 1% for the week, indicating a balance between supply and demand. Analysts expect a quiet easter weekend but are divided about the next directional move in Bitcoin.
Network economist Timothy Peterson said that the US High Yield Index Effective Yield has gained over 8%. There have been 38 such instances since 2010, and Bitcoin has risen 71% of the time three months later. Bitcoin recorded a median gain of 31% and the worst loss of -16%. Based on historical data, Peterson anticipates Bitcoin to trade between $75,000 and $138,000 within 90 days.
Not everyone shares a bullish view. Bloomberg’s Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone said in a post on X that Bitcoin and the S&P 500 Index may drop toward their respective 200-week simple moving average, which historically acts as a floor during major corrections. Bitcoin’s 200-week SMA is close to $46,000.
What are the critical support and resistance levels in Bitcoin? What cryptocurrencies may rally if Bitcoin breaks above its overhead resistance?
Bitcoin has stayed above the 20-day exponential moving average ($83,704) for the past several days, but the bulls have failed to challenge the 200-day simple moving average ($88,098).
The failure to start a rally could put pressure on the BTC/USDT pair in the near term. If the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls have given up. That opens the gates for a drop to $78,500 and subsequently to the vital support at $73,777.
If buyers want to prevent the downside, they will have to swiftly push the price above the 200-day SMA. That indicates the corrective phase may be over. The pair may surge to $95,000 and eventually to the psychological level of $100,000.
The pair has been trading inside a tight range between $83,000 and $86,000. Failing to break above the overhead resistance may have tempted the short-term bulls to book profits, pulling the price below the moving averages. Trading inside the range is likely to remain random and volatile.
A break and close below the range could start a downward move to $80,000 and then to $78,500. On the other hand, a break and close above $86,000 could propel the pair to $89,000.
BNB (BNB) is facing resistance at the downtrend line, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded ground to the bears.
The moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If buyers drive the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to $644.
Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from the downtrend line, it signals that the bears are active at higher levels. A break below $576 could keep the pair inside the triangle for some more time.
The pair has reached the downtrend line, where the bears are expected to pose a strong challenge. The crucial support on the downside is the 50-SMA and then $576. If the price rebounds off the support, it indicates buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a break above the downtrend line. The pair may then climb to $620.
On the contrary, a break and close below $576 signals that the buyers have given up. That could pull the price down to $566, extending the stay inside the triangle for a while longer.
Hyperliquid (HYPE) rose and closed above the $17.35 overhead resistance on April 19, but the bulls are facing selling at higher levels.
If the price turns up from $17.35, it suggests that every minor dip is being bought. That clears the path for a rally to $21 and thereafter to $25.
Alternatively, a break and close below $17.35 signals that the bears are trying to trap the aggressive bulls. The next support on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($15.32). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to overcome the obstacle at $17.35.
The optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the HYPE/USDT pair turns down and breaks below the moving averages.
The pair has dropped to the breakout level of $17.35. If the price rebounds off $17.35 and rises above $18.54, it signals that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That enhances the prospects of a rally to $21.
Conversely, if the price skids below $17.35, it suggests that the bears are trying to regain control. The 50-SMA is the critical support to watch for on the downside because a break below it indicates that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair may then descend to $14.65.

Bittensor (TAO) broke above the moving averages and has reached the downtrend line, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense.
If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the TAO/USDT pair is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA ($249). A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA improves the prospects of a rally above the downtrend line. The pair could then surge to $360.
Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bears remain in control. The pair may then slump to the $222 support, where the buyers are expected to step in.
The RSI has risen into the overbought zone, suggesting a short-term pullback is possible. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it signals a positive sentiment. That increases the possibility of a break above the downtrend line. There is minor resistance at $313, but it is likely to be crossed.
Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-EMA indicates that the short-term buyers are booking profits. That may pull the pair to the 50-SMA.
Render (RNDR) has broken out of the overhead resistance at $4.22, signaling that the bulls are attempting a comeback.
A close above the $4.22 level will complete a bullish double-bottom pattern. There is resistance at $4.83, but it is likely to be crossed. The RNDR/USDT pair could then travel toward the pattern target of $5.94.
The 20-day EMA ($3.72) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the moving averages indicates that the markets have rejected the breakout above $4.22. That could open the doors for a drop to the support at $2.50.
The pair has cleared the overhead hurdle at $4.22, indicating an advantage to buyers. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily and will try to pull the price back below the breakout level. If the price rebounds off $4.22 with strength and rises above $4.48, it signals that the bulls have flipped the level into support. The pair may then start an up move toward $5.
Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it suggests that the breakout may have been a bull trap. The pair may then drop toward the critical support at $3.60.

42aea195aa2f21d470e6f69b001c8ef4,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin up 33% since 2024 halving as institutions disrupt cycle,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-up-33-halving-analysts-institutional-cycle-acceleration," Institutional investment and Bitcoin ETFs have accelerated the four-year Bitcoin halving cycle despite growing uncertainty fueled by global trade wars. 
Bitcoin holders are celebrating one year since the 2024 Bitcoin halving by praising BTC’s resilience amid a global trade war and suggesting an accelerated market cycle due to a growing institutional presence.
The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced block rewards from 6.25 Bitcoin (BTC) to 3.125 BTC, slashing new BTC issuance in half.
Despite rising concerns over a global trade war and escalating tariff tensions between the United States and China, BTC has climbed more than 33% since April 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
“So, even though Bitcoin’s showing resilience, I think the mix of past experiences, economic uncertainty, and this selling pressure is keeping investors on the sidelines, waiting for a stronger green light before they jump in,” said Enmanuel Cardozo, a market analyst at asset tokenization platform Brickken.
Cardozo added that institutional investment from firms such as Strategy and Tether could speed up Bitcoin’s traditional four-year halving cycle. He added:
However, Bitcoin’s trajectory remains tied to broader monetary policy, the analyst added. He said a US Federal Reserve rate cut in May or June may “pump more money into the system and push Bitcoin up faster.”
The halving is a built-in feature of the Bitcoin network that assures Bitcoin’s scarcity, which is considered one of BTC’s defining monetary characteristics.

Institutional adoption and Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may be contributing to a shorter market cycle, according to Vugar Usi Zade, chief operating officer at Bitget exchange.
Continued institutional buying, including by Bitcoin ETFs, paired with Bitcoin’s rising scarcity, may accelerate Bitcoin’s rise to new highs, he told Cointelegraph.
“With growing scarcity triggered by the halving, Bitcoin will likely retest its all-time high if it breaches the $90,000 mark in the coming weeks,” Usi Zade said. “While the halving offers a good basis for growth based on demand and scarcity, the timeline for impact on price can vary over time.”
He noted that Bitcoin’s growth remains closely tied to traditional financial markets and investor sentiment.

Bitcoin reached a new all-time high above $109,000 on Jan. 20, 273 days after the 2024 Bitcoin halving, signaling an accelerated market cycle.
In comparison, it took Bitcoin 546 days to reach an all-time high after the 2021 halving, and 518 days after the 2017 halving, according to data shared by popular crypto trader Jelle, in an April 8 X post.

Bitcoin (BTC) tapped 3-day lows into the April 20 weekly close as analysis warned of a fresh liquidity grab next.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dropping 1.5% to $83,974 on the day before rebounding.
Still broadly less volatile over the weekend, Bitcoin sought to stem the week’s downside as doubts appeared over the strength of nearby support.
Investigating the current liquidity setup across exchange order books, popular analyst Mark Cullen was particularly skeptical of $83,000.
“Bitcoin 90k liquidity still calling. BUT, i think the 83k level isn't safe, those lows from last Sunday and Wednesday are likely to get run first,” he summarized on X. 
Cullen and others nonetheless saw a short-term BTC price range between $83,000 and $86,000 staying in place over the Easter holiday weekend.
📈#Bitcoin Range Bound‼️The long easter weekend is likely yo see $BTC play out a range between83k and 86k. With it al ready sweeping the highs of the range late last week, IMO we are going to see liquidity sought from the lows before continuation higher.#Crypto #BTC https://t.co/iNllx4LexJ pic.twitter.com/6zx5gXZx79
“Pretty slow market during this long weekend as expected. I think next week will get interesting as the charts are quite compressed. Any decent good/bad headline could spark a pretty large move I think. Even if its just from positions getting squeezed,” popular trader Daan Crypto Trades continued. 
An accompanying chart showed BTC price action relative to the latest closing point of CME Group’s Bitcoin futures, potentially inviting the creation of a “gap” that could provide a short-term price magnet.
Fellow trader Roman meanwhile eyed what could become a return to multimonth lows as part of a bullish inverse head and shoulders reversal pattern.
“If volume is decreasing on the way to 76k, I’ll take longs,” he told X followers.
Updating readers on the daily chart, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital had good news.

Bitcoin, he confirmed, had definitively broken out of a multimonth downtrend without violating it during retests as support.
“Bitcoin hasn't just broken the Downtrend and successfully retested it as support for the first time since Downtrend formation,” he wrote.
As Cointelegraph reported, the fate of the downtrend had been on the radar for weeks, with not everyone agreeing that price had left it behind for good.

22f5275ce836131e4d429c5155b47072,Cointelegraph,Is Bitcoin price going to crash again?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-bitcoin-price-going-to-crash-again," Bitcoin’s drop below $85,000 raises the risk of a correction to $50,000 especially if macro conditions keep boosting global demand for gold. 
Bitcoin (BTC) price has rebounded by 14.60% after plunging below $75,000 for the first time in five months in April. However, its failure to break above the $85,000 resistance level decisively has sparked concerns that the ongoing recovery may trap bulls.
Bitcoin could continue to underperform as Donald Trump’s intensifying global trade war drives investors toward safer assets like gold, according to Bloomberg’s Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone.
McGlone argues that risk assets are showing signs of reverting to long-term means, mainly their 200-week moving averages that have historically served as critical floor during major price corrections.
As of April 20, Bitcoin’s 200-week moving average was around $46,300, down by about 45% compared to current price levels at around $85,000. 
Meanwhile, gold has surged to a record high of $3,115 per ounce in April, up over 19% year-to-date. The precious metal continues to attract capital amid rising geopolitical tensions, recession fears, and tariff-driven inflation risks. 
According to McGlone, this rotation into hard assets like gold and out-of-high-beta plays like crypto reflects a classic flight to safety.
The divergence between gold and Bitcoin is evident in institutional investment trends.
For instance, the ETFs backed by the precious metal have seen consistent inflows in 2025, attracting over $27.10 billion year-to-date, according to data resource World Gold Council.
Conversely, Bitcoin ETFs have experienced $12.38 billion in outflows, according to data resource Glassnode.
However, not all analysts see gold’s rally lasting. Veteran trader Peter Brandt pointed to a possible “blow-off top” for gold, warning that such rapid gains typically end in sharp reversals, though timing the peak remains risky. 
Some believe that if gold’s momentum fades, Bitcoin could continue its bull run, providing its history of lagging the precious metal rally by several months.
Glassnode data reveals a growing divergence between short-term and long-term Bitcoin holders, hinting at potential early-stage bear market conditions, albeit not a confirmed crash.
Notably, short-term holders (STHs)—those who acquired Bitcoin within the past few months—have been facing substantial unrealized losses relative to the current drawdown. 
This level of loss, normalized by drawdown percentage, is comparable to the early stages of past bear markets, including late 2018 and early 2022.
In contrast, long-term holders (LTHs)—those holding Bitcoin for over 155 days—remain broadly in profit. 
However, the data suggests a growing risk: as BTC top buyers from recent highs age into LTH status, more unrealized losses could shift into the long-term cohort. Historically, most shifts in loss absorption have preceded bear market regimes.
Therefore, the risk lies in whether LTH profitability can withstand prolonged market weakness—or if capitulation sets in as it did during previous downtrends. 
For now, caution may be warranted, but this data does not yet confirm an outright crash.
Some analysts view the current dip as a standard correction within a broader bull trend. Among them is pseudonymous analyst PlanB, who argues that Bitcoin remains structurally bullish.
According to PlanB’s Stock-to-Flow (S2F) and 200-week moving average models, Bitcoin’s current price action mirrors historical consolidation phases seen before major rallies. 
In particular, past cycles show that when the 200-week simple moving average (black line) converges with the 200-week geometric mean (gray line), Bitcoin tends to surge soon after. This convergence is happening again in April.
PlanB also highlights the red-dot phase—representing the 6-month pre-halving to the 18-month post-halving window—as historically bullish. Bitcoin is now seven months into this period, which has consistently delivered explosive price action in previous cycles.
""On-chain indicators still point to a bull market,"" PlanB noted, suggesting that the recent pullback is more likely a setup for the next leg higher above $100,000 than a breakdown into a bear market.

18827405c7c2c4a79756c8a0a7c1a899,Cointelegraph,Altcoin unit bias 'absolutely destroying' crypto newbies — Samson Mow,https://cointelegraph.com/news/altcoin-unit-bias-crypto-participants-disadvantage-bitcoin-samson-mow," Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow said that once ""you remove"" unit bias from altcoins, it becomes clear how overvalued altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Ether actually are. 
Jan3 CEO Samson Mow says that Bitcoin dominance hasn’t yet exhausted its upside trajectory after analyzing how altcoin prices would stack up against Bitcoin if all were on equal terms of total supply.
His forecast for Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance to rise further comes as the ratio has already exceeded the levels many crypto analysts expected it would reach by late 2024.
“Unit bias is absolutely destroying the uninitiated,” Mow said in an April 19 X post. Mow suggested that unit bias — a psychological method in behavioral economics that suggests that individuals usually like to own a complete unit or stock regardless of its price and size — often causes less experienced investors to assume cheaper whole altcoins are better value than owning part of a Bitcoin.
“You can buy one twenty-one millionth of the BTC supply for ~$85,000,” Mow said. He asked, “What happens if you remove unit bias from alts to calculate the equivalent of 1/21 million?”
He pointed out that Ether (ETH) would be priced at $9,200, XRP (XRP) would be priced at $5,800, and Solana (SOL) would be priced at $3,400 — representing increases of approximately 278,746%, 470%, and 2,328%, respectively, from their prices at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.
“No way these alts are worth that much,” Mow said. 
Sunny Po, an anonymous Bitcoin proponent, said on Jan. 12 that “Unit bias is a core foundational framework of the normie mind. ‘Cheaper better.’”
Mow said that “most” altcoins take advantage of unit bias by implementing a very high total supply so market participants “can’t figure out what they’re buying.”
Related: XRP: Why it’s outperforming altcoins — and what comes next
Based on his calculations, Mow said Bitcoin dominance is going “so much higher.” Bitcoin dominance — a metric that reflects Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization — is often used by traders to gauge when Bitcoin might be nearing a price peak. 
Historically, when Bitcoin Dominance declines, it often signals the start of altcoin season, with capital flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins to find higher returns.
At the time of publication, Bitcoin Dominance is sitting at 63.69%, as per TradingView data.
Several crypto analysts were forecasting Bitcoin Dominance to top out at 60% in late 2024 before the beginning of an altcoin season. 
In August 2024, Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen said “I don’t think it is going back up to 70%, my target for Bitcoin dominance has been 60%.”

Financial educator, author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and investor Robert Kiyosaki recently forecasted a $1 million Bitcoin (BTC) price by 2035 as the US dollar continues to lose value to inflationary monetary policies.
""I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $ 1 million, Gold will be $30,000, and silver $3,000 a coin,"" Kiyosaki wrote in an April 18 X post.
Kiyosaki, a self-described gold bug, has long argued that bearer assets like gold, silver, and more recently Bitcoin, are critical hedges against inflation and key to long-term generational wealth accumulation through economic cycles.
""In 2025, credit card debt is at all-time highs, US debt is at all-time highs, unemployment is rising, 401k’s are losing, and pensions are being stolen. The USA may be heading for a greater depression,"" Kiyosaki warned.
Kiyosaki, like many other sound money advocates, has continually warned of an impending financial crash brought on by expansionist monetary policies and fiscal irresponsibility. Bitcoin maximalists argue that loose monetary policy will drive the price of Bitcoin to seven-figures.

In May 2024, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey forecasted that the price of a single BTC would be $1 million by 2030 and could appreciate further.
Trader and investor Michaël van de Poppe told Cointelegraph, in November 2024, that Bitcoin could go to $1 million. However, the price appreciation would come with hyperinflation and a broader economic collapse, the trader said.
Blockstream CEO Adam Back said the price of Bitcoin could rise to $1 million per coin if the Trump administration established a Bitcoin strategic reserve for the United States and started buying Bitcoin on the open market.
On Dec. 10, Eric Trump delivered the keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and predicted that Bitcoin would hit $1 million due to its scarcity.
More recently, in February 2025, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said that Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million by 2030 if demand for the digital asset continues to grow.

At the time, Wurster told the financial news outlet that Schwab wanted to offer crypto directly to its clients but was waiting for a positive regulatory catalyst.
Following the re-election of Donald Trump in the United States, Wurster said the financial services company anticipated a much better regulatory environment to expand its digital asset services.
The Schwab CEO previously said he did not own any cryptocurrency, adding that he felt ""silly"" for not investing in the nascent asset class as it has continued to provide outsized investment gains.
In January 2025, Charles Schwab partnered with the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) to provide customized exchange-traded funds and cryptocurrency services for the upcoming ""Truth.Fi"" service.
Truth.Fi will encompass digital assets and traditional financial services as a proposed alternative to the legacy banking system.
TMTG CEO, and White House official, Devin Nunes said the goal of TMTG is to provide an option for individuals worried about unfair banking practices and ""cancellation, censorship, debanking, and privacy violations committed by big tech and woke corporations.”

ec6df0458c5eb140420565ba611929a8,Cointelegraph,UK firm buys $250M Bitcoin as analysts eye quiet Easter weekend,https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-investment-firm-buys-250-m-bitcoin-analysts-quiet-easter-weekend," Crypto firms and whales continue accumulating Bitcoin, as analysts predict a steady weekend for crypto valuations without White House announcements. 
Whales and institutions are increasing their Bitcoin holdings ahead of Easter, as market analysts predict a weekend with less volatility after two weeks of heightened volatility driven by escalating global trade tensions.
A wallet linked to London-based investment firm Abraxas Capital acquired 2,949 Bitcoin (BTC) worth more than $250 million during the four days leading up to April 19.
In the latest transaction, the firm bought over $45 million worth of Bitcoin from Binance on April 18, according to crypto intelligence firm Lookonchain, citing Arkham Intelligence data.
The investment came days after Michael Saylor’s Strategy bought $285 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $82,618 per BTC, as the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holders signal continued confidence in Bitcoin, amid global tariff uncertainty.
Large Bitcoin investors, or whales, continue accumulating, absorbing over 300% of Bitcoin’s yearly issuance as exchanges continue losing coins at a historic pace, Cointelegraph reported on April 18.

Despite continued accumulation from whales and institutions, volatility concerns were raised by significant movements from the medium-term Bitcoin cohort, which holds coins for an average of three to six months.
Over 170,000 Bitcoin entered circulation from the medium-term cohort, a development that may signal “imminent” crypto market volatility, according to pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet.
“The effect of this metric on LTF moves is overstated as large onchain movement of coins hardly ever affects weekend price action since it’s not on liquid markets or CEX markets,” analysts at Bitfinex exchange told Cointelegraph, adding:

Marcin Kazmierczak, chief operating officer of RedStone Oracles, added that the recent movements may be operational transfers, not necessarily signs of imminent selling pressure.
Still, concerns over weekend volatility have been amplified over the past two weeks after the Mantra (OM) token’s price collapsed by over 90% on Sunday, April 13, from roughly $6.30 to below $0.50, triggering market manipulation allegations and highlighting “critical” liquidity issues in the industry.
Two weeks ago, on April 6, Bitcoin fell below $75,000 on Sunday, as investor concerns spread from a record-breaking  $5 trillion sell-off from the S&P 500, its largest on record.
The correction was caused by Bitcoin’s 24/7 trading availability, which made it the only large liquid asset available for de-risking on Sunday, Blockstream CEO Adam Back told Cointelegraph.
“On a weekend, there’s not much volume. So you have a worse risk of rapid sort of flash crashes or flash dips that get filled in again,” he said.
