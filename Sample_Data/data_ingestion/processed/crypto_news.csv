Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

US President Donald Trump has placed cryptocurrency at the center of his economic strategy, marking a major policy shift for the US blockchain industry, according to Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek.
Trump hosted a White House Crypto Summit on March 7, signaling that he intends to make crypto policy a national priority and make the US a global hub for blockchain innovation. 
The summit marked a “truly historic day at the White House,” Marszalek said in a March 8 X post.

Marszalek credited Trump with reversing policies like Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which allegedly led to crypto and tech firms being denied banking services under the Biden administration.
The difficulties of finding banking partners may indeed be a thing of the past for crypto firms after the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) eased its stance on how banks can engage with crypto just hours after Trump vowed to end the prolonged crackdown restricting crypto firms’ access to banking services
Related: US Bitcoin reserve marks ‘real step’ toward global financial integration
The crypto summit also comes as two major bills await congressional approval: the Stablecoin bill and the Market Structure bill, aiming to help lift the regulatory uncertainty around the US crypto industry.
Marszalek said ongoing dialogue with key regulators, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could see “landmark legislation” pass. He added:
The CEO’s comments come a day after Trump signed an executive order on March 7, which outlined a plan to establish a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases rather than actively acquiring Bitcoin (BTC) through market purchases, Cointelegraph reported.
While no direct BTC purchases were announced, the bill added that the US Treasury and Commerce secretaries could make “budget-neutral strategies” to buy more Bitcoin for the reserve, “provided that those strategies impose no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”
Some analysts see the US Bitcoin reserve plan as the first “real step” for Bitcoin’s integration into the global financial system.
“The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained, told Cointelegraph.

While Trump has previously highlighted his intentions to bolster crypto innovation in the US, issuing regulatory frameworks takes time and setting the “right regulatory tone” will be crucial for the administration, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of Fideum — a regulatory and blockchain infrastructure firm focused on institutions.

ae5e6eebcb17a75c348ea31e8bf56a86,Cointelegraph,50% of female crypto investors seek long-term wealth creation — Survey,https://cointelegraph.com/news/50-female-crypto-investors-prefer-long-term-strategies-survey," Women are increasingly investing in crypto, favoring Bitcoin and long-term holdings, but 81% still report a lack of education as a barrier to adoption. 
Women are showing an increased interest in cryptocurrency investments, with the majority favoring long-term strategies and lower-risk assets like Bitcoin despite reporting a lack of industry knowledge, according to a new Bitpanda survey shared exclusively with Cointelegraph.
According to the survey, 50% of female crypto investors prioritize long-term financial growth, with 49% holding digital assets for up to five years and 39% planning to hold for more than five years.
Women also tend to prefer safer digital assets. Bitcoin (BTC) remains the most popular investment choice, with 30% of respondents selecting it as their first digital asset investment compared to 24% of men.
More than 54% of the 1,400 surveyed investors made their first investments in Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) or XRP (XRP).

“Women tend to build more diverse portfolios and focus on long-term wealth creation rather than chasing short-term gains,” according to Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget cryptocurrency exchange:

“Women typically adopt a ‘sit on their hands’ investment style,” with less trading frequency than men, Chen said, citing a Charles Stanley study:

Nkiru Uwaje, co-founder of blockchain liquidity platform Mansa, believes this reflects a fundamental difference in investment psychology between men and women:
“Preference of holding may also lie in analyzing how investments may change. Instead of reactively selling during dips, female investors tend to observe how assets behave through market cycles,” she added.
The majority of women prefer Bitcoin, but not necessarily due to risk aversion alone.
“This approach often stems from thorough research and strategic patience,” according to Mary Pedler, founder of INPUT Comms blockchain and tech-focused communications agency.
“Many women I’ve worked and communicated with do deep research before investing and seldom make FOMO-driven decisions,” she told Cointelegraph, adding:
While female crypto investors are rising, a lack of education remains the main challenge for mainstream crypto adoption among women.
Over 81% of respondents admitted to being inexperienced investors, with 24% of female investors citing a lack of investment knowledge as their biggest challenge, while 41% pointed to financial constraints, according to Bitpanda’s survey.

However, Bitpanda’s female users have shown steady growth. Women who started investing in January 2024 have seen an average increase of 8.1% in their investments over the past year. 
Chen highlighted that just 26% of crypto holders are women.
To bridge this gap, initiatives like Women in Ethereum Protocol (WiEP) emphasize the need for proper education, clear guidance and structured support to encourage more women to enter the crypto space.
“Women need proper education, clear guidance, and support, starting with small investment amounts,” WiEP representatives told Cointelegraph.

838f1d506670fa3e17bc6f4fec855615,Cointelegraph,FDIC resists transparency on Operation Chokepoint 2.0 — Coinbase CLO,https://cointelegraph.com/news/fdic-transparency-operation-chokepoint-coinbase-clo," At least 30 tech and crypto founders were reportedly “secretly debanked” in the US during Operation Chokepoint 2.0. 
Some US government agencies continue to deny transparency regarding their role in Operation Chokepoint 2.0, a period during the Biden administration when crypto and tech founders were allegedly denied banking services, according to Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal.
The collapse of crypto-friendly banks in early 2023 sparked the first allegations of Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Critics, including venture capitalist Nic Carter, described it as a government effort to pressure banks into cutting ties with cryptocurrency firms.
Despite recent regulatory shifts, agencies like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) continue to “resist basic transparency” efforts, Grewal wrote in a March 8 post on X.
“They haven’t gotten the message,” he wrote.

Coinbase has requested that the FDIC provide details in court on how it conducted “due diligence” to ensure no documentation related to the event was destroyed. However, the agency “repeatedly refused to do so,” Grewal said.
His comments come a day after the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) eased its stance on how banks can engage with crypto just hours after US President Donald Trump vowed to end the prolonged crackdown restricting crypto firms’ access to banking services.

Grewal claimed the FDIC has also not fully cooperated with Coinbase’s documentation requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA):
Moreover, Grewal said the FDIC has redacted a total of 53 pages, with many other pages containing “heavy redactions rendering the documents unintelligible.”
Grewal added that his team requested that the FDIC give a “sworn testimony” to the court.
On March 4, Coinbase also submitted a FOIA request to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to find out how many investigations and enforcement actions were brought against crypto firms between April 17, 2021, and Jan. 20, 2025.

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw nearly $370 million worth of net outflows on March 7 as investors reacted to President Donald Trump’s plan for a US strategic Bitcoin reserve, according to data from Farside Investors. 
The outflows indicate institutional investors are wary of Bitcoin (BTC) exposure after Trump’s March 6 executive order — which created a national Bitcoin reserve but didn’t instruct the government to buy Bitcoin — disappointed traders. 
“While [Trump’s executive order] acknowledges crypto’s role in global finance, the lack of fresh purchases disappointed markets,” Alvin Kan, chief operating officer of Bitget Wallet, told Cointelegraph.

On March 6, Trump signed an executive order creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and, separately, a digital asset stockpile to hold other cryptocurrencies. 
They will both initially comprise assets acquired by law enforcement and other legal proceedings. 
The order asks officials to “develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies impose no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”
“This limited scope fell short of market expectations and resulted in considerable disappointment,” Temujin Louie, CEO of Wanchain, a crosschain interoperability protocol, told Cointelegraph.
However, Trump’s “order opens the possibility of acquiring additional Bitcoin as well, as long as the acquisitions don’t cost taxpayers,” Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, told Cointelegraph. 
“That could introduce a new buyer to the Bitcoin ecosystem.”
Bitcoin’s spot price dropped more than 2% on March 7, according to data from Google Finance. 
Meanwhile, data from the CME, the US’ largest derivatives exchange, shows declines of more than 2% across most of Bitcoin’s forward curve, which comprises futures contracts expiring at staggered dates. 
Futures are standardized contracts representing an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a particular future date.
Even without the US government actively buying up Bitcoin, the “US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve means… Other countries will buy bitcoin… [and] Financial institutions have no excuse” not to add BTC allocations, Ryan Rasmussen, asset manager Bitwise’s head of research, said in an X post. 
The sell-off is “a simple buy the rumor, sell the news event,” Austin Arnold, co-founder of Altcoin Daily, told Cointelegraph. “Long term, this is bullish.”

United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US government will use stablecoins to ensure that the US dollar remains the world’s global reserve currency during the White House Crypto Summit on March 7.
Bessent reiterated the Trump administration’s promise to end the war on crypto and committed to rolling back previous IRS guidance and punitive regulatory measures. Bessent then turned his attention to stablecoins and said:

The President was also critical of the Biden administration for selling portions of the seized Bitcoin (BTC), which he said amounted to billions in losses through premature selling.
Many of the attendees of the first White House Crypto Summit remarked on the historic nature of the event, which cements a seismic shift in the US government’s stance toward the digital asset industry.

Overcollateralized stablecoins, which use short-term US Treasury bills and cash deposits to back their digital fiat tokens and thus drive demand for US debt instruments, have been pitched as a way to extend US dollar dominance.
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller also voiced support for using stablecoins to prop up the dollar in February 2024.
Waller argued that the corrosive effect of cryptocurrencies on the market share of the US dollar would be mitigated by stablecoin demand.

In February 2025, Waller reiterated his stance that stablecoins could help preserve the dollar's status as the global reserve currency by overcoming capital controls in foreign countries and enhancing payment rails.
As part of this effort to leverage stablecoins to defend the US dollar, US representatives French Hill and Bryan Steil introduced a stablecoin bill titled the Stable Act of 2025 to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for dollar-pegged digital fiat tokens.

34c35ca8a74861a6d9a5204084db8b40,Cointelegraph,Darknet marketplace wallet with over $400M BTC awakens after 9 years,https://cointelegraph.com/news/darknet-marketplace-wallet-400m-btc-awakens-9-years," The wallet went dormant with 5,000 BTC after the marketplace, which facilitated drug and weapons sales, went down in April 2016. 
A crypto wallet holding over $400 million in Bitcoin (BTC) linked to the darknet marketplace Nucleus has awakened after nine years, according to Arkham Intelligence. On March 7, the entity controlling the wallet moved $77.5 million in BTC to three new addresses, leaving $365 million in the primary wallet.
The wallet had been dormant since April 2016, when the marketplace shut down with  5,000 BTC from vendor and customer deposits. At the time, the funds were worth roughly $2.1 million, according to Arkham’s tracker.
Related: Who is the mysterious Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto?
Nucleus was one of many darknet marketplaces that proliferated around that time, facilitating the sale of drugs, weapons and other contraband. While the official story surrounding its shutdown was that it was hacked, conspiracy theories swirled. Some thought that the Nucleus site admins were executing an exit scam, while others believed that the admins had been arrested.
Transactions on Nucleus, like for many other darknet marketplaces, were made largely in Bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency was harder to track and, therefore, offered some level of anonymity for those engaged in such activities.
The reawakening of Nucleus’ wallet came a day after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. The BTC for the reserve will initially come from crypto already seized through forfeitures, although there is room for “budget-neutral” acquisitions of more coins.
Since the beginning of 2023, the price of Bitcoin has risen significantly. It jumped from less than $17,000 per coin in January 2023 and has since hit an all-time high of around $108,000.
During this bull run, many dormant wallets have awakened, some dating to the 2010s, like the Nucleus marketplace wallet. In July 2023, an 11-year dormant wallet with 1,037 BTC awoke, with the owner moving the entire stash.
In 2024, other dormant wallets followed. In May 2024, three Satoshi-era wallets awoke, with one moving 687 BTC and two others moving 1,000 BTC, worth $61 million at the time. In June 2024, a whale transferred 8,000 BTC from a five-year dormant wallet, and in September 2024, five miner wallets from the Satoshi era awakened after 15 years and started to move their coins.
There may be an interesting development on the horizon as well: Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that quantum computing could lead to hackers breaking into early Bitcoin wallets, leading to more presumed “lost” coins coming back into circulation.

White House crypto czar David Sacks has further elaborated on the US government’s decision to treat Bitcoin as a special reserve asset, calling it a “scarce” digital resource that could benefit the country over the long term. 
In a March 7 interview with Bloomberg Technology, Sacks said, “We’ve decided that Bitcoin is scarce, it’s valuable, and that it’s strategic for the United States to hold on to this as a long-term reserve asset.”
Sacks was referring specifically to the roughly 200,000 Bitcoin (BTC) currently in the US government’s possession. However, he acknowledged that the exact number of BTC held by the government is unknown because there’s never been a comprehensive audit.
“We’re going to do a full government-wide audit to find out what digital assets we actually have so they can be safeguarded and moved into a strategy that maximizes their long-term value,” he said.
David Sacks said the US government will build a strategic digital asset stockpile. Source: Bloomberg Technology 
President Donald Trump’s March 6 executive order calling for a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile directed federal agencies to conduct a full audit of their cryptocurrency holdings. 
Regarding the digital asset stockpile, “The difference there is that the secretary of the treasury [Scott Bessent] will exercise responsible stewardship over those assets, and he has the discretion to rebalance the portfolio or to sell items in that portfolio, but that’s not true for Bitcoin,” said Sacks.
With the Bitcoin reserve, the “goal is long-term preservation,” he said. “With the stockpile, the goal is [...] portfolio management, in essence.”
Sacks said the digital asset portfolio strategy could include the sale or even staking of digital assets based on the treasury secretary’s discretion. 
Sacks didn’t single out any particular altcoin and cautioned against reading too much into President Trump’s March 2 announcement declaring Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) as being part of the stockpile.
“The president just mentioned the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap, so I think people are just reading into this a little bit too much,” said Sacks. Ultimately, a decision on which assets to include will depend on the government-wide audit.

Trump’s executive order and Sacks’ commentary failed to provide a short-term boost to Bitcoin and crypto prices, but that could be about to change as markets fully dissect the significance of the latest US policy developments. 
Joe Kelly, CEO of Bitcoin financial services company Unchained, told Cointelegraph, “Markets may still exercise caution until we see the scale and strategy behind this accumulation, but the bigger picture isn’t about short-term price movements.” He added:
Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, singled out one sentence from the executive order fact sheet as being “mildly bullish for BTC” in the short term: “The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional Bitcoin.”
“Does this mean some potential asset swapping, say from euro to Japanese yen to Bitcoin?” asked Barthere. 
Beyond the executive order hype, Barthere said Bitcoin’s price action is being influenced by macroeconomic conditions, including the economy and potential changes to Federal Reserve policy.
“The recent Bitcoin price pullback was unavoidable, as I forecasted at the beginning of the year, as the broader financial market needed to digest the impacts of Trump’s tariffs policy,” said CK Zheng, former global head of risk for Credit Suisse and founder of ZX Squared Capital. 
“I believe Bitcoin is currently in the process of bottoming out in the near term and will rebound through 2025 as more pro-crypto rules and regulations roll out,” Zheng said.
Zheng believes the strategic Bitcoin reserve may serve as a catalyst for future nation-state adoption.

US President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve called for a budget-neutral strategy to acquire more coins, which includes adding more BTC through asset forfeitures and possibly converting other reserve assets to the cryptocurrency.
The US government maintains strategic reserves covering a range of assets and commodities, including gold, petroleum, natural gas, foreign currency, medicine, land, critical rare-earth minerals and even cheese.
The most liquid of these strategic reserve assets are petroleum, gold and foreign currency.
According to the US Department of Energy, the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve has approximately 395 million barrels of crude oil as of Feb. 28, with a total holding capacity of over 713 million barrels.

Assuming a price of $67 per barrel of West Texas Crude Oil, this gives the US petroleum reserve a value of over $26.4 billion.
Data from the US Treasury shows that the department currently holds over 258.6 million troy ounces of gold, valued at over $10.9 billion as of Feb. 28.
The Treasury Department’s convertible foreign currency reserves, as of Jan. 31, total over $35 billion. Sygnum Bank estimates that the US Bitcoin reserve could grow BTC’s market capitalization by roughly 25%, or approximately $460 billion.

In July 2024, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the Bitcoin Act to the US Senate, outlining a plan for the US government to acquire 5% of Bitcoin's total supply — 1 million BTC.
The bill also proposed the US government hold Bitcoin for 20 years as a hedge against inflation.
In November 2024, Senator Lummis suggested converting some US gold reserves to Bitcoin as a budget-neutral way to purchase the 1 million BTC, which would have cost approximately $90 billion at the time.

Lummis had previously argued that the US Treasury should convert some of its assets to purchase BTC but did not specify which assets should be converted.
White House adviser David Sacks also called Bitcoin digital gold and the recently established Bitcoin strategic reserve “a digital Fort Knox” for the supply-capped, decentralized cryptocurrency.
Sacks added that the scarce nature of BTC sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies as a unique store of value.

The blockchain platform linked to United States President Donald Trump took the crypto market downturn as an investment opportunity, tripling its Ether holdings in a week ahead of the White House’s first Crypto Summit on March 7.
Meanwhile, Solana was hit by nearly half a billion dollars worth of outflows in February as cryptocurrency investors sought safer investments following a wave of memecoin scams and rug pulls.
The decentralized finance (DeFi) platform linked to US President Donald Trump significantly increased its Ether holdings over the past week as the cryptocurrency’s price briefly dipped below $2,000.

Solana saw nearly half a billion dollars in outflows last month as investors shifted to what were perceived to be safer digital assets, reflecting growing uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market.
Solana (SOL) was hit by over $485 million worth of outflows over the past 30 days, with investor capital mainly flowing to Ethereum, Arbitrum and the BNB Chain.
The capital exodus came amid a wider flight to “safety” among crypto market participants, according to a Binance Research report shared with Cointelegraph.

“Overall, there is a broader flight towards safety in crypto markets, with Bitcoin dominance increasing 1% in the past month to 59.6%,” the report stated.”Some of the capital flowed into BNB Chain memecoins, driven in part by CZ’s tweets about his dog, Brocolli,” it added.
Beyond Solana, total cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped by 20% in February, driven by growing negative sentiment, Binance Research noted.
Alongside macroeconomic concerns, the crypto investor sentiment drop was mainly due to the $1.4 billion Bybit hack on Feb. 21, the largest exploit in crypto history. 
Disappointment in Solana-based memecoin launches has also curbed investor appetite, particularly after the launch of the Libra token, which was endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei.
