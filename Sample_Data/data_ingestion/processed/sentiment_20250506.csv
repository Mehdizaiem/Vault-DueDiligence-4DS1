a8a3edbd3a39e18da3ba8b1d61060c56,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin could rally regardless of what the Federal Reserve FOMC decides this week: Here’s why,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-could-rally-regardless-of-what-the-federal-reserve-fomc-decides-this-week-here-s-why," Bitcoin rallied back above $95,000, and the gains could continue even after this week’s FOMC. 
Key Takeaways:
The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.
The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.
The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal environment for alternative hedge assets such as cryptocurrencies.
Economist and investor Jim Paulsen notes that when Fed funds trade above a “neutral” interest rate (Fed Funds minus the annual core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index), the economy has historically moved toward recession or a “growth recession,” a period of sluggish growth with rising unemployment and weak consumer demand. Similar patterns since 1971 support this analysis.
According to Paulsen, the Fed will likely be compelled to lower interest rates. Moreover, central bank Chair Jerome Powell is under significant pressure from US President Donald Trump, who has criticized the Fed for not reducing the cost of capital quickly enough.
Concerns about overheated markets remain as the US consumer inflation exceeds the 2% target, and April unemployment rates of 4.2% suggest no signs of economic weakness.
Market expectations, as reflected in Treasury yield futures, show a 76% chance of interest rates at 4.0% or lower by Sept. 17. This probability has dropped considerably from 90% on April 29, according to the CME FedWatch tool. 
Traders are growing less confident that the Fed will ease monetary policy. While this may initially seem bearish for risk assets, it could prompt the Treasury to inject liquidity into markets to support government spending.
Regardless of the FOMC’s decision, some analysts point out that the Fed’s recent $20.5 billion Treasury bond purchase on May 5 signals renewed intervention. Additional liquidity has historically been bullish for cryptocurrencies, especially as the US dollar lags behind other major global currencies. Consequently, investors are increasingly seeking alternative hedges rather than holding cash.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped below 100 for the first time since July 2023, as investors retreat from US markets amid economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, gold has risen over 12% in the past 30 days and is now trading just 2% below its all-time high of $3,500. Declining confidence in the US Treasury’s ability to finance its debt favors scarce assets such as Bitcoin.
While the probability of multiple rate cuts has diminished, this scenario may still be favorable for cryptocurrencies. Should the Fed be pressured to expand its balance sheet, it would likely fuel inflation and erode the value of fixed-income investment factors that ultimately support cryptocurrencies.

c435bd01d41d3f71db0bac6a682ab1b6,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin bulls rush into long positions ahead of May 7 Fed FOMC interest rate decision,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bulls-rush-into-long-positions-ahead-of-may-7-fed-fomc-interest-rate-decision," Bitcoin price catches a bid as bulls defend the $94,000 level as support and pile into margin long positions ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision. 
Key Takeaways:
Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.
A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.
BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.
Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.
Similarly, Bitcoin futures open interest (OI) exhibited a swift increase of 2,000 BTC, i.e., roughly $189 million, over the past few hours. A rise in OI and a 15% increase in aggregated volume imply consistent buying pressure despite the price dip.
The aggregated funding rate remains near neutral, indicating balanced sentiment between longs and shorts over the past eight hours. However, funding rates have fluctuated, with brief spikes to 0.018% on May 6, suggesting periodic optimism among leveraged traders.
MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe also identified Bitcoin’s bounce and said that BTC could continue to recover in the markets. The analyst said,

Swissblock, an investment management firm, revealed that Bitcoin's momentum typically slowed down before the last five interest rate decisions, followed by a sharp increase in price volatility. In an analysis on X, the firm presented a chart tracking Bitcoin’s 25-day rate of change (ROC) from October 2024 to May 2025. 
Bitcoin’s price steadily climbed in the charts whenever the ROC trended up or went positive. It was mainly observed during October-November 2024, and recently in April 2025. 
Consequently, when the ROC tapers off, BTC corrects, an outcome observed in January-February 2025. Recent data indicates that the ROC remains on an uptrend in May 2025, which increases the possibility of a price gain for Bitcoin. 
Swissblock emphasized that the FOMC meeting is a potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s next move, noting that the rate decision and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s tone could spark volatility in financial markets.

9c3d54ff024c983285c210f9b16a31d5,Cointelegraph,New Hampshire governor signs crypto reserve bill into law,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-hampshire-bitcoin-reserve-law," The bill is the first of its kind in a US state to become law after Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a similar bill on May 2 and two Florida crypto bills were withdrawn on May 3. 
New Hampshire became the first US state to allow its government to invest in crypto currencies including Bitcoin (BTC), after Governor Kelly Ayotte signed a bill passed by the legislature into law. 
In a May 6 notice, Ayotte announced on social media that New Hampshire would be permitted to “invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals” through a bill passed in the state Senate and House of Representatives. House Bill 302, introduced in New Hampshire in January, will allow the state’s treasury to use funds to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, eliminating many tokens and memecoins.
“The Live Free or Die state is leading the way in forging the future of commerce and digital assets,” said New Hampshire Republicans in a May 6 X post.
With the signing of the bill into law, New Hampshire becomes the first of several US states considering passing legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, including an initiative with the federal government. A similar bill in Arizona passed the state’s House in April but was vetoed by Governor Katie Hobbs on May 2, and Florida’s government withdrew two crypto reserve bills from consideration on May 3.
Related: Bitcoin’s role as a reserve asset gains traction in US as states adopt
The efforts to create crypto reserves in different US states come as US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers propose similar policies at the federal level. Trump signed an executive order in March to establish a “Digital Asset Stockpile” and a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.”
Senator Cynthia Lummis, who sponsored the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, proposed that the US government could hold more than 1 million BTC through civil and criminal forfeiture seizures. The bill is currently being considered by members of the US Senate Banking Committee.

5fc35cc3edbc2b3df953efcfbbd7e896,Cointelegraph,Standard Chartered sees BNB more than doubling in 2025,https://cointelegraph.com/news/standard-chartered-forecasts-bnb-price-more-than-doubling-this-year," The native token of Binance's BNB Chain could tap $1,275 by the end of 2025, the asset manager said. 
Asset manager Standard Chartered predicts that Binance’s ecosystem token, BNB, could more than double in price this year, according to an analyst report reviewed by Cointelegraph. 
The asset manager sees BNB’s price rising to approximately $1,275 per token by the end of 2025 and as high as $2,775 by the end of 2028, according to the research report. 
As of May 6, BNB trades at nearly $600 per coin, for a fully diluted value (FDV) of approximately $84 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
“BNB has traded almost exactly in line with an unweighted basket of Bitcoin and Ethereum since May 2021 in terms of both returns and volatility,” Geoff Kendrick, an analyst at Standard Chartered, wrote in the research note. 
“We expect this relationship to continue to hold, driving BNB’s price from around USD 600 currently to USD 2,775 by end-2028.”
Related: How much Bitcoin can Berkshire Hathaway buy?
The BNB token is the native cryptocurrency of Binance BNB Chain, a layer-1 (L1) blockchain network affiliated with the world’s largest centralized exchange (CEX). 
The BNB Chain has less developer activity than L1s such as Ethereum or Avalanche and its ecosystem is comparatively “old-fashioned”,” Standard Charter said. 
More than 60% of the network’s onchain economic activity involves decentralized exchanges (DEXs), compared to a more diverse spread on other L1s, it said.
However, the asset manager noted that this could also serve as a source of stability for BNB Chain. 
“Assuming Binance remains one of the largest CEXs, BNB’s value drivers are unlikely to change anytime soon,” Geoff Kendrick, an analyst at Standard Chartered, wrote in the research note. 
“Given this, we see potential for BNB to serve as a form of benchmark, or average, for digital asset prices more broadly,” he added. 
BNB Chain is the fourth largest L1, with nearly $6 million total value locked (TVL), according to data from DeFiLlama.
On May 5, asset manager VanEck filed to list the first BNB exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.

d102d1a5b0a9fa2a67c02f6eb654d236,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin price rallied 1,550% the last time the ‘BTC risk-off’ metric fell this low",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-rallied-1-550-the-last-time-the-btc-risk-off-metric-fell-this-low," Bitcoin price traded at $4,000 the last time the BTC Risk-Off signal fell to its current lows. Is another 1,550% rally in the making? 
Key Takeaways:
The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.
Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.
On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement. 
In 2019, the same signal preceded a staggering 1,550% rally that saw Bitcoin soar above $68,000 in 2021. 
Data from CryptoQuant indicates that the Risk-Off signal combines six metrics: downside and upside volatility, exchange inflows, funding rates, futures open interest, and market capitalization. Collectively, they provide a balanced view of correction risk, making the signal a data-oriented gauge for market trends. 
The last time the Risk-Off Signal indicated a low-risk investment environment, Bitcoin was valued at $4,000. Several factors can explain the price disparity. 
The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in 2024 opened the floodgates to institutional capital, boosting demand and stabilizing prices. In fact, ETFs and public companies now hold 9% of the Bitcoin supply. 
🚨LATEST: ETFs and public companies now hold 9% of Bitcoin's supply! Spot ETFs own 5.5% just 1 year after launch, while public firms like Strategy hold 3.5%. Institutional adoption is reshaping $BTC's market—less supply, shifting dynamics. 👀👀(h/t: @ecoinometrics ) pic.twitter.com/iC892RveP2
Data from Fidelity Digital Assets noted that Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased three to four times that of equity indexes, down from triple-digit volatility in its early years, as illustrated in the chart below. Between 2019 and 2025, the 1-year annualized realized volatility dropped by more than 80%. 
This maturing market absorbs capital inflows with less price disruption. Thus, growing mainstream adoption, regulatory clarity, and Bitcoin’s increasing role as a hedge against inflation have bolstered its value, setting a higher price floor compared to 2019.

Cointelegraph recently reported that the Macro Chain Index (MCI), a composite of onchain and macroeconomic metrics, flashed a buy signal for the first time since 2022, when it accurately predicted the market bottom at $15,500. 
Historically, MCI’s RSI crossover has preceded massive rallies, such as the more than 500% surge in 2019. Combined with rising futures open interest and favorable funding rates, the MCI suggests Bitcoin could break $100,000 over the coming few weeks. 
Anonymous crypto analyst Darkfost pointed out that Bitcoin’s network activity index has declined sharply, reflecting reduced transaction volume and fewer daily active addresses since December 2024. The drop in UTXOs further indicates waning demand for block space, a pattern often seen in bear markets.
However, the analyst explained that it doesn’t confirm a bearish outlook. Macro indicators remain strongly bullish, suggesting this lull could be a strategic entry point for long-term investors.

How to tell the difference,https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-it-a-bull-or-bear-market-how-to-tell-the-difference," Identify a bull or bear market by watching price trends, trading volumes, investor sentiment, economic signals and whether optimism or fear drives the action. 
Not sure if you’re in a bull or bear market? This guide breaks down how to spot the difference using price action, volume, sentiment and onchain data. Learn how to recognize market cycles, what signals to watch for and how to adjust your strategy for each phase so you can trade smarter.
Crypto markets can feel like emotional rollercoasters, prices soaring one month, then crashing the next. You're not alone if you’ve ever wondered whether you are in a bull or a bear market.
In the simplest terms:
A bull market is when prices keep going up, people are excited and there’s a general sense that the future is bright. Think back to late 2020 and early 2021; Bitcoin (BTC) climbed from around $10,000 to nearly $70,000. New projects were launching daily and it felt like everyone from your cousin to your Uber driver was buying crypto.
On the flip side, a bear market is when prices drop consistently, investors pull back, and sentiment sours. A good example? 2022. After hitting all-time highs, the market tumbled. Bitcoin fell below $20,000, projects collapsed (remember Terra?), and even veteran traders started discussing “building in the bear.”
Knowing what kind of market you’re in helps you make smarter moves, and that’s why this all matters. You don’t want to ape into memecoins during a downtrend or panic-sell just before a rebound. 
Recognizing market phases helps you invest more strategically, manage risk and crucially, keep your emotions in check. Which, in crypto, is half the battle.
Did you know? In 18th-century England, “bearskin jobbers” were early short-sellers, traders who sold bearskins they didn’t yet own, betting prices would fall. The saying “don’t sell the bear’s skin before you’ve caught the bear” stuck, and so did the metaphor. The term bull came later, not only as the bear’s opposite, but also because of the upward motion of a bull’s horns when attacking.
Sure, crypto is “numbers on a chart.” But, it’s also stories, headlines and entire communities’ constantly shifting mood. Here’s how to understand bull and bear cycles: 
Prices rise in a bull market, sure. What’s more important is that they keep rising, often over weeks or months. You’ll see major coins climbing steadily and altcoins riding the wave. 
A textbook example? Bitcoin’s run in 2020–2021, where it jumped from ~$10,000 to $69,000. That rally had momentum, institutional backing (Tesla, Strategy, etc.), and serious retail FOMO.
Or Dogecoin’s meme-fueled sprint in early 2021, going from joke status to $0.45 thanks to Elon tweets and Reddit hype.
You’ll know sentiment is bullish when X feels euphoric, everyone’s calling for a BTC moonshot and new projects are launching daily with sky-high valuations. Money flows in fast, and even risky bets feel like obvious plays. That’s when you know that positive investor sentiment is in the air. 
Bull runs often line up with low interest rates, easy access to credit and generally tech-friendly conditions. During the 2020 bull, for instance, pandemic-era stimulus checks and low borrowing costs gave retail and institutional investors more ammo to deploy into digital assets.
Bear markets will drag on until the cows come home. Prices fall, then fall some more, and every slight bounce is sold off. Think 2018’s “crypto winter,” when Bitcoin crashed from $20,000 to around $3,000.
Or 2022’s brutal downturn, when BTC dropped from $69,000 to under $20,000. That crash wasn’t really about price either; it was fuelled by implosions like Terra-Luna, Celsius and the FTX scandal. The dominoes just kept falling.
Bear markets tend to feel like the party’s over. 
During bear phases, fear takes over. Headlines turn grim, social media goes quiet and even die-hard believers start questioning their convictions. Funding dries up, dev teams go silent and “exit liquidity” jokes make the rounds.
Macro headwinds don’t help. High interest rates, inflation fears or tightening monetary policy often make things worse. In 2022, for example, the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes made risk assets, including crypto, far less appealing.
While no single metric can give you 100% certainty, there are a handful of time-tested indicators that traders and analysts rely on. Let’s break down the indicators you can use, aside from the obvious one (price). 
Volume tells you how much conviction is behind the price moves.
In a bull market, rising prices are often backed by strong trading volume. More buyers step in, more liquidity enters the market and the rally feels supported.
During a bear market, volume tends to dry up. Price drops are met with weak buying pressure and it can feel like no one wants to touch the market.
Low volume plus a declining price? Not a great sign if you’re hoping for a bounce.
Did you know? During the 2021 bull run, Dogecoin experienced a surge in trading volume, with nearly $70 billion traded in a single day as its price soared to $0.45
One tool many investors rely on is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. It measures social media activity, volatility, Google search trends and more to gauge whether investors feel optimistic (greedy) or pessimistic (fearful).
Extreme greed often pops up near the top.
Extreme fear tends to appear near the bottom, though it can hang around in deeper downturns.
Check it daily, but don’t let it drive your whole strategy. It’s a mood ring, not a crystal ball.
You don’t have to be a chart wizard to spot a few helpful signals.
Moving averages: When the price is consistently above the 200-day moving average, it’s generally bullish. When it dips below, that’s often a warning sign. These are long-term trend indicators, not day-trading tools.
Relative strength index (RSI): This measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold: Readings above 70 suggest it’s overheated and due for a pullback, while readings below 30 may indicate it’s oversold with potential to bounce.
None of this is gospel, but it helps you get a feel for momentum.
Sometimes the biggest market movers don’t show up on a chart.
Bullish signs might include:
Big-name institutional adoption (like BlackRock applying for a Bitcoin ETF).
Friendly regulatory news or court wins for crypto firms.
Major tech milestones (think Ethereum upgrades or layer-2 rollouts).
Meanwhile, bearish signs often look like:
Regulatory crackdowns (the SEC targeting major exchanges).
High-profile security breaches or protocol failures.
Global instability — inflation, war or financial contagion.
Once you know what to look for, the next step is figuring out where. Fortunately, crypto comes with a treasure trove of free tools if you know where to dig.
 If you want to understand price action, you need solid charts.
TradingView is known for customizable charts and technical indicators.
Cointelegraph offers clear overviews of prices, market caps and volume trends that are especially useful for tracking newer or smaller tokens.
Did you know? TradingView’s charting tools are integrated directly into many of the world’s top crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. 
Crypto is more mood than math. 
Tools like LunarCrush track social media activity, influencer buzz and trending tokens. If Dogecoin starts heating up again, you’ll probably see the early signs there.
Want to know what the whales are doing? Platforms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant surface data like wallet flows, miner activity and exchange balances. It’s like reading the blockchain’s heartbeat. You’ll often spot capital shifts before they show up in the price.
Understanding the cycle is one thing. Knowing how to act on it is another. Your playbook should change depending on whether you’re riding a bull or surviving a bear.
Trend following: When the market’s running hot, sometimes the best move is to go with the flow, but stay disciplined. Focus on assets in strong uptrends, and don’t get caught chasing green candles without a plan.
Profit-taking: Set targets and honor them. It’s easy to get greedy when everything’s pumping, but taking profits on the way up helps you avoid the dreaded round trip: watching your gains vanish in the next drawdown.
Risk management: Even bull markets pull back. Use stop-losses or trailing stops to lock in gains and guard against surprise reversals. You’ll thank yourself later.
Defensive positioning: Sometimes, the smartest trade is no trade. Moving part of your portfolio into stablecoins or sticking to less volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) can help preserve capital while others panic.
Dollar-cost averaging (DCA): Trying to time the exact bottom? Good luck. DCA smooths the ride by spreading your entries over time, lowering your average cost and helping you stay engaged without overcommitting.
Focus on fundamentals: Bear markets strip away the noise. What survives are the projects with real use, strong teams and long-term vision. If you’re holding through a downturn, ensure you’re holding for the right reasons.
Bull or bear, crypto never stops moving, but that doesn’t mean you have to react to every swing. Price trends, sentiment shifts, volume patterns and fundamentals can all clue you in on where you are in the cycle. Armed with the right tools and a calm mindset, you can tune out the noise and act with clarity.
Markets reward preparation, and knowing whether you’re in bull territory or bear country is one of the most powerful tools you can have.
Happy trading!

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

5e8aefe8e27e49a1d5ccd11c8cd4cd5b,Cointelegraph,Binance founder CZ says Bitcoin could hit $500K–$1M this cycle,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cz-says-bitcoin-could-hit-500-k-1-m-this-cycle," Changpeng Zhao expects Bitcoin to reach between $500,000 and $1 million this market cycle, driven by institutional adoption, growing government accumulation and a pro-crypto US policy. 
Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao expects Bitcoin’s price to top at $500,000 to $1 million during this market cycle.
During an interview with Rug Radio published on May 5, Zhao said that he expects Bitcoin to reach up to one million dollars during this market cycle. He also highlighted the role of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in this rise, saying that the increasing institutionalization of Bitcoin is a good thing for the market:
Zhao explained that the ETFs are “bringing the traditional institution money into crypto” and “most of the money in the US is institutional money.” He said that “Bitcoin is going up because most of the ETFs are Bitcoin-based.”
Founder of Obchakevich Research Alex Obchakevich told Cointelegraph that “70% [of Bitcoin’s growth] is new institutional capital, the rest is just a redistribution of crypto assets.” He highlighted the role of the ETFs in pushing Bitcoin’s price higher:

Zhao also highlighted that governments are increasingly buying Bitcoin as well, which “is really good for the price action.” He added:
The remarks follow multiple countries accumulating Bitcoin. In late April, El Salvador, the world’s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, continued acquiring Bitcoin despite the International Monetary Fund’s comments claiming the opposite. In the seven days leading to April 27, the country acquired 7 BTC worth over $650,000 at the time.
The country’s Bitcoin Office data shows that El Salvador currently holds nearly 6,170 BTC worth almost $580 million. The Kingdom of Bhutan is also accumulating Bitcoin. January reports suggested that a new economic hub in the country plans to set up a strategic cryptocurrency reserve comprising major crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH).

The former Binance CEO also noted that the US “has pivoted 180 degrees under a pro-crypto president,” since the election of President Donald Trump. He said:
Talking about retail investors, he said that they “had 15 years to buy.” Consequently, “if they’re late now, that was their choice.”

478bad19d3852d3adf798d30a2da834c,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin risks sub-$92K retest as BTC price fails to match 4% gold gains,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-faces-91-6-k-retest-btc-price-fails-match-gold-gains," Bitcoin is once more lagging behind relentless gold as the macroeconomic landscape continues to spark surprises — and levels closer to $90,000 may be next. 
Key points:
Bitcoin is struggling again as gold retakes the limelight with week-to-date gains of nearly 5%.
Bitcoin’s correlation with gold is under scrutiny amid ongoing macroeconomic shifts.
Traders see a short-term slump amid a wider BTC price rebound.
Bitcoin (BTC) eyed fresh month-to-date lows into the May 6 Wall Street open as “directionless” crypto markets contrasted with a gold rebound.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price momentum stalling at $95,000 before the latest daily close. 
Inching closer to the key yearly open support level at $93,500, BTC/USD appeared caught in limbo while gold returned to outperform.
XAU/USD was up 1.5% on the day at the time of writing, with week-to-date gains already at 4.4%.
“Crypto implied vols remain suppressed, with front-end skew drifting back toward neutral and spot largely directionless,” trading firm QCP Capital wrote in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers.
QCP noted various swings across the macro spectrum, with the dollar staying lower and emerging market currencies, especially the Taiwanese dollar, surging alongside gold.
“At the same time, the FX shakeup coincides with a nearly 3% surge in gold on Monday, as investors lean into the weaker-dollar narrative and price in geopolitical risk premia, including prospective US trade diplomacy,” it continued.
With Bitcoin yet to follow suit, QCP saw an “increasingly binary” next phase, with one outcome being that BTC “decouples from gold’s safe haven bid and relinks with broader risk proxies.”
In its own analysis, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter nonetheless saw the “first gold, then Bitcoin” narrative sticking.
“In April, Bitcoin joined the gold run, increasing correlation for the first time in months. Between April 7th and April 21st, gold surged +15% along with +12% in Bitcoin,” it observed in an X thread on May 5. 
Examining technical data, Bitcoin traders suggested that BTC/USD may be pausing within a broader comeback.

Evidence for this came from the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator, a measure of trend strength that gave conflicting signals on longer and shorter timeframes.
#btc weekly MACD about to cross bullishly from a position of strength... pic.twitter.com/x2JjK9rHNW
Popular trader Dave The Wave revealed a bullish signal on the weekly MACD, while daily behavior confirmed a bearish crossing below the zero line.
“BTC is consolidating between last week’s high and low, awaiting tomorrow’s FOMC meeting and Jerome Powell’s speech. Meanwhile, the daily MACD is crossing bearish, signaling slowing momentum,” fellow trader Titan of Crypto summarized.
His post referred to the week’s key macro event, the meeting of the Federal Reserve to decide on interest rate changes, due on May 7.
Earlier, Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, warned that the yearly open was unlikely to hold as support.
“To summarize, I'll be pleasantly surprised if the YO holds,” he told X followers.

26a745fd3eabfd39faa752424ca20c77,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin price forms two BTC futures gaps after Coinbase premium flips negative,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-btc-futures-gaps-after-coinbase-premium-turns-negative," Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium drops below zero, signaling a bearish sentiment and potential volatility amid CME gaps on both sides of the market. 
Key takeaways: 
Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index turned negative for the first time in 15 days, indicating defensive short-term sentiment among US investors.
Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 
Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.
Cointelegraph reported early signs of selling pressure, with Bitcoin recording over $300 million in negative spot cumulative volume delta (CVD) from April 27 to April 29, indicating sustained sell-side activity.

This selling pressure persisted over the weekend, contributing to the price decline, with anonymous crypto analyst Exitpump noting that Bitfinex whales exhibited significant selling pressure compared to Coinbase and Binance. 
Additionally, approximately 8,000 BTC in open interest (OI) was removed across futures markets, reflecting reduced leverage. However, recent data shows that the aggregated futures bid-ask delta is turning positive, suggesting potential buying interest in derivatives markets.
Bitcoin is at a pivotal juncture, trading around $94,000 between two CME futures gaps. The gaps are between $92,000 and $92,500 from two weeks ago and $96,400 and $97,400 from the recent weekend. CME gaps often act as magnets for price action, with historical trends showing a tendency to fill these gaps in a matter of days. 
Bitcoin is expected to test at least one gap this week, with a potential drop to $92,000 more likely after Bitcoin failed to hold its position above its 200-day simple moving average (blue line). 
Bitcoin has lost its position above the 200-day SMA for the first time since April 11, possibly indicating a trend shift in the lower time frame (LTF) chart.
However, choppy price action is likely in the short term due to overhead resistance at $97,000-$98,000 (CME gap 1) and key support at $93,000, where multiple liquidity levels are present.
