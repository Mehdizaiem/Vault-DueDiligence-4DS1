3acbba4e02f45f0294735afaa8948b1b,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin breakout to $120K on radar as markets forget Fed July rate cut,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-breakout-120k-on-radar-markets-forget-fed-july-rate-cut," Bitcoin is likely consolidating before its next upward push, traders agree, while the macro picture looks tricky for risk assets as the Fed stays hawkish. 
Key points: 
Bitcoin continues to range around $103,000 as bulls struggle to keep upside momentum going.
Traders favor short-term BTC price gains eventually returning, while overall faith in the bull market varies.
Fed rate cuts seem increasingly far off despite encouraging inflation data.
Bitcoin (BTC) hugged familiar territory around the May 14 Wall Street open as traders awaited fresh US macro cues.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed $103,000 remaining a BTC price magnet.
Bulls had managed another trip to $105,000 the day prior, with momentum nonetheless lacking after brisk gains throughout the first half of the month.
Now, traders eyed consolidation prior to a return to volatility, with predictions favoring further upside.

‚ÄúEven though $BTC looks great IMO, I still stand by the fact that it probably moves sideways from here for a while, which would probably be great news for alts tbh,‚Äù popular trader Byzantine Trader wrote in one of his latest posts on X.¬†
Despite seeing the Bitcoin bull market unwinding sooner rather than later, fellow trader Roman agreed that higher highs would come first.
‚ÄúLooking for more upside if we can continue to consolidate here as consolidation = continuation of trend. Yes my macro views believe the $BTC bull is close to over but there‚Äôs still some room for short term upside,‚Äù he told X followers.¬†
Macro influences were less pronounced on the day thanks to a gap in US inflation data releases.

The day prior, a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) print had failed to spark a fresh crypto rally, with eyes now on the Producer Price Index (PPI) numbers due on May 15.
Commenting, trading firm QCP Capital stressed that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs hawkish policy was dictating market expectations. Interest rate cuts in the first half of 2025, a would-be risk-asset tailwind, were being increasingly priced out.
‚ÄúUS CPI came in below expectations, providing a welcome reprieve to inflation worries and bolstering bets on rate cuts,‚Äù QCP wrote in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers.¬†
Data from CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch Tool put the Fed‚Äôs September meeting as the likely occasion to deliver the next cut.
‚ÄúMarket pricing has also adjusted accordingly, with two rate cuts now expected for 2025, down from four just a month prior,‚Äù QCP added.

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here‚Äôs what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a ‚Äúkey‚Äù $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin‚Äôs correction may see the world‚Äôs first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin‚Äôs right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins ‚Äúdo not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws‚Äù and ‚Äúare akin to collectibles.‚Äù
Source: David Sacks
‚ÄúAs such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,‚Äù the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn‚Äôt be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins ‚Äúmay be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.‚Äù

South Korea could soon follow Hong Kong in legalizing spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as the country‚Äôs top presidential candidates have expressed pro-crypto positions. 
Still, some industry observers remain cautious about the likelihood of near-term regulatory change.
‚ÄúAll three major South Korean presidential candidates support #Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investment,‚Äù  Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of onchain data platform CryptoQuant, wrote in a May 14 X post.
Currently, Bitcoin ETFs and institutional crypto investments are banned in South Korea, meaning that ‚Äú100% [of the] volume comes from retail,‚Äù Ju added.

On May 6, South Korea‚Äôs Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung promised to legalize spot crypto ETFs, lower transaction fees and ‚Äúcreate a safe investment environment so that young people can [build] assets and plan for the future, according to a report from The Korean Economic Daily (KED).
The Democratic Party made similar promises in its 2024 election campaign, including the legalization of spot crypto ETFs, but progress has been delayed, KED reported.

While the crypto-friendly perspectives of the leading candidates suggest a promising future for digital asset legislation in South Korea, regulation experts remain skeptical.
‚ÄúThe candidates‚Äô pro-crypto pledges to push to legalize spot Bitcoin ETFs and reduce fees signal a potential shift. But history tempers optimism,‚Äù Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain adviser, told Cointelegraph, adding:
‚ÄúA pro-crypto president could drive reform, aligning South Korea with global trends like the US, where Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over billions in net inflows,‚Äù Lian said, adding that the Financial Services Commission‚Äôs tone also suggested ‚Äúregulatory openness‚Äù for cryptocurrencies.
However, the People Power Party, elected in 2022, also promised to lift the crypto ETF ban and revise the controversial one-exchange-one-bank rule, ‚Äúbut failed to act before President Yoon‚Äôs impeachment,‚Äù Lian said.
Over in Hong Kong, the first batch of Bitcoin and Ether-based ETFs launched for trading on April 30, 2024, but saw disappointing trading activity compared to their US counterparts, Cointelegraph reported.

d7e2edb668338b5f1ab3377007ec0a52,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin more of a ‚Äòdiversifier‚Äô than safe-haven asset: Report,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-stock-correlation-safe-haven-portfolio-diversifier," ‚ÄúBitcoin still needs to mature before decoupling from stock markets,‚Äù but presents significant benefits as a portfolio diversifier, according to the co-founder of Redstone Oracles. 
Bitcoin‚Äôs fluctuating correlation with US equities is raising questions about its role as a global safe-haven asset during periods of financial stress.
Bitcoin (BTC) exhibited a strong negative correlation with the US stock market when analyzing the short-term, seven-day trailing correlation, according to new research from blockchain data provider RedStone Oracles, shared exclusively with Cointelegraph.
However, RedStone said that the 30-day indicator signals a ‚Äúvariable correlation‚Äù between Bitcoin price and the S&P 500 index, with the correlation coefficient ranging from -0.2 to 0.4.
This fluctuating correlation suggests that Bitcoin ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt consistently function as a true hedge for equities‚Äù due to its lack of a strong negative correlation below -0.3, which is needed for ‚Äúreliable counter movement during market stress,‚Äù the report said.

The research suggests that while Bitcoin may not be a dependable hedge against stock market declines, it offers value as a portfolio diversifier.
This fluctuating dynamic signals that Bitcoin often moves independently from other assets, potentially offering additional returns while other assets are struggling. Still, Bitcoin has yet to mirror the safe-haven dynamics of gold and government bonds, RedStone suggests.

While Bitcoin is poised to grow into a safe-haven asset in the future, the world‚Äôs first cryptocurrency still needs to ‚Äúmature‚Äù as a global asset, according to Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and chief operating officer at RedStone.
‚ÄúBitcoin still needs to mature before decoupling from stock markets,‚Äù Kazmierczak told Cointelegraph, adding:
Meanwhile, Bitcoin will see growing recognition as a portfolio diversifier, with an annualized return of over 230% for the past five years, which ‚Äúsignificantly outperformed‚Äù both stocks and traditional safe-haven assets, Kazmierczak said, adding that ‚Äúeven a small 1‚Äì5% Bitcoin allocation can meaningfully enhance a portfolio‚Äôs risk-adjusted returns.‚Äù
Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs declining volatility supports BTC‚Äôs growing maturity as a global financial asset. Bitcoin‚Äôs weekly volatility hit a 563-day low on April 30, a development that may signal more stable price action.
Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility fell below the realized volatility of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, signaling that investors are increasingly treating Bitcoin as a long-term investment vehicle, Cointelegraph reported on May 13.

ca3205eb3ee896edf2d4be65fd0999ad,Cointelegraph,How to spot a fake crypto investment platform: 10 red flags,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-spot-a-fake-crypto-investment-platform-10-red-flags," Scam crypto investment platforms are everywhere, and spotting them isn‚Äôt as complicated as you may think. 
Fake crypto investment platforms give themselves away in a few obvious ways.
Many use fake reviews, incorrect contact information and unrealistic promises to lure you in.
The best approach is a healthy dose of skepticism. Watching for these red flags will keep you safe while investing.
The burgeoning cryptocurrency market, with its lack of centralized authority and a constant flow of inexperienced users, makes digital assets a prime target for scammers. Fake crypto investment platforms are a common scam method, masquerading as useful services for crypto traders.
Before signing up for any crypto investment platform, it‚Äôs essential to learn the telltale signs of a scam.¬†
This article will detail what to watch out for and how to verify if a crypto investment platform is legitimate. These tips will teach you how to avoid crypto scams.¬†
Did you know? The FTC hosts a crypto scam detection guide that allows you to view common crypto scams, sorted by company name, scam type and other keywords.¬†
Here are 10 crypto investment scam red flags to watch for when choosing a cryptocurrency investment platform.
What to watch for: Fake crypto investment platforms will try to entice you with unrealistic promises, like ‚ÄúMake 1 Bitcoin in just a few days!‚Äù A legitimate crypto exchange won‚Äôt need to sell you with fake deals.
How to verify: The platform‚Äôs services should speak for themselves. None of them will give you a special advantage over the other, especially not one that can net you a Bitcoin just days after signing up. This is one of those prime crypto scam warning signs.
What to watch for: It‚Äôs easy to make an ‚Äúour team‚Äù page on any website, let alone one offering a decentralized service. At a minimum, these pages should include photos, descriptions and links to LinkedIn or other verified social media platforms.
How to verify: Double-check team pages for legitimacy. Some scammers might also set up fake social media pages, so scan those for authentic interactions and delve deep into each team member‚Äôs project history.
What to watch for: Let‚Äôs be honest, most scammers won‚Äôt expect customers to read their project white paper. It‚Äôs probably something they threw together in ChatGPT or even plagiarized from a legitimate project.
How to verify: Read a project‚Äôs white paper in-depth and watch for legitimate use cases. Make sure the project solves a real problem, has a legitimate purpose and a realistic plan for the future. Don‚Äôt fall for buzzwords!
Did you know? Justin Sun, founder of Tron‚Äôs long-standing blockchain platform, has been accused of plagiarizing Ethereum‚Äôs white paper.
What to watch for: Just as it‚Äôs super easy to fabricate an ‚Äúour team‚Äù page, scammers can place fake endorsements all over their home page. It‚Äôs as quick as copying and pasting a company logo like Forbes.
How to verify: Instead of trusting an exchange‚Äôs webpage, look up news releases and other proof of these supposed endorsements. Cointelegraph provides a directory of legit exchanges to help you identify fake crypto websites.
What to watch for: Now, regulatory requirements may vary depending on whether you‚Äôre looking at a centralized or decentralized platform, but if you‚Äôre looking at the former, know that centralized platforms cannot operate without regulatory approval from your government.
How to verify: Typically, you can check a government database to confirm if a platform is licensed. If it‚Äôs not, it may not be trustworthy. For example, the CEO of Tether (USDT) refuses to comply with the European Union‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The company is known for its resistance to comply with regulatory policies, causing industry-wide suspicion.
What to watch for: Pushy sales tactics are a big red flag. If a platform reaches out to you through social media, such as through a direct message on X, Discord or Telegram, you can be sure it‚Äôs a scam. Scammers might claim to be an employee or crypto influencer ready to provide you with an ‚Äúexclusive offer‚Äù or ‚Äúlimited time deal.‚Äù¬†
How to verify: A real exchange would never reach out to potential customers like this, especially via social media. Social media DMs are widespread crypto scam tactics.
Did you know? Some top crypto scams in 2024 were phishing attacks, rug pulls and fake airdrops.¬†
What to watch for: Crypto investment platforms with a real product, even decentralized ones, will have contact information. Even Uniswap has a support email with which to get in touch. Centralized entities should also have addresses of their offices, ones that you can cross-reference with Google Maps for legitimacy purposes.¬†
How to verify: If a crypto investment platform is missing any contact information, consider that a red flag. This is an easy sign to miss.
What to watch for: Tech products, blockchain-based and otherwise, feature user reviews front and center on their websites. That said, you can tell if these are real or manufactured. Keep an eye out for reviews with repetitive language and a lack of a critical eye, which only praise the platform. Glowing reviews are often fake, possibly even written by AI.
How to verify: Search for platform reviews on Reddit and other social media sites. Other users will tell you if the platform is legit or not. If a platform has no social media accounts, there is more reason to avoid it.
What to watch for: Some fraudulent platforms may offer airdrops or giveaways as promotions to attract positive attention. However, participating in the fake airdrop might require inputting a wallet seed phrase or private key.¬†
How to verify: Legitimate airdrops will be announced on social media platforms like X, the platform‚Äôs blog on Medium or its official website. They‚Äôll only ask for your wallet address, nothing more.
What to watch for: A crypto exchange with no fiat offramping means it‚Äôs not registered with local financial institutions. The platform might demand that you only work in crypto.
How to verify: If you sign up for an exchange and it immediately asks you to send crypto into your wallet on the platform instead of linking a payment method like a bank or card, this is a big red flag.
Cryptocurrency investment scams thrive on urging you to make rash decisions. It‚Äôs always best to be skeptical when choosing where to trade, invest or hold your crypto. Take your time, do your research, and double-check every piece of information a platform provides. These crypto fraud prevention tips will help keep you safe, protecting your assets and peace of mind. Use them to create a crypto scam checklist.

c085d2a965e2cca5b5f580af8ca309c6,Cointelegraph,"Strategy will beat all public equities with Bitcoin, analyst says",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-strategy-number-one-publicly-traded-equity-analyst," Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor told the Financial Times in a new documentary that his company is well-positioned to become a $10 trillion enterprise one day. 
Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy, the world‚Äôs largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, may become the top publicly traded equity one day, according to a Strategy analyst.
Strategy will be the ‚Äúnumber one publicly traded equity in the entire market‚Äù because of its future financial strength enabled with Bitcoin (BTC), Strategy analyst Jeff Walton¬†predicted¬†in the new Financial Times documentary, Michael Saylor‚Äôs $40 billion Bitcoin bet.
The company currently holds about 568,840 Bitcoin, worth roughly $59 billion, and Walton said that advantage could push it past all other publicly listed firms in the future.  
‚ÄúStrategy holds more of the best assets and the most pristine collateral on the entire planet than any other company, by multiples,‚Äù Walton said.
The analyst pointed to the firm‚Äôs ability to rapidly raise capital as another indicator of its strength. In November 2024, Strategy raised $12 billion in just 50 days.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly hard to raise $100 million of capital, and they just raised $100 million of capital 120 times in 50 days, and they were able to buy Bitcoin with that capital. That‚Äôs insane,‚Äù Walton said.
In the documentary, Saylor also paints a bullish picture of the future due to Bitcoin adoption by Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy.
‚ÄúI think that MicroStrategy is in a position where we can grow from a $100 billion enterprise to a $1 trillion enterprise to a $10 trillion enterprise,‚Äù Saylor said.
He also predicted that Bitcoin would one day reach a price of $13 million per coin:

Walton and Saylor‚Äôs predictions on Strategy potentially beating all publicly traded equities in the future come as the company ranks as the 151st largest company in the world, with a market capitalization of $117 billion, according to CompaniesMarketCap.
To become the largest, Strategy would need to surpass Microsoft, whose current market cap exceeds $3.3 trillion.
Despite his bullish stance on the future of both Strategy and Bitcoin, Saylor has not ignored the possibility that BTC could suffer major losses.
Reiterating his previous claims, Saylor emphasized that Strategy‚Äôs capital structure is constructed so that it would still be stable even if Bitcoin falls 90% and ‚Äústays there for four or five years.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be a good outcome for the equity holders. The people at the top of the capital structure would suffer because they‚Äôre levered, but everybody else in the capital structure would get paid out,‚Äù he said.

f204f1a36c274048763b46696be47fb0,Cointelegraph,Kazakhstan to become ‚ÄòCentral Asia‚Äôs crypto hub‚Äô with reforms: Minister,https://cointelegraph.com/news/kazakhstan-eyes-central-asia-crypto-hub-status-with-reforms," Kazakhstan‚Äôs digital minister says lifting crypto restrictions and expanding regulations could turn the country into Central Asia‚Äôs top blockchain hub. 
Kazakhstan has the potential to become a leading crypto hub in Central Asia if regulatory restrictions are eased, according to Kanysh Tuleushin, the country‚Äôs first vice minister of digital development, innovation and aerospace industry.
In a recent op-ed for the Kazakhstanskaya Pravda newspaper, Tuleushin said digital mining and smart policy shifts could position Kazakhstan as a regional leader in blockchain innovation.
‚ÄúIf all restrictions were lifted and digital asset trading was allowed across Kazakhstan, the impact could be significant,‚Äù he wrote. ¬†
‚ÄúKazakhstan might become Central Asia‚Äôs crypto hub,‚Äù Tuleushin added, suggesting that broader legalization and taxation could add hundreds of billions of the country‚Äôs tenge currency to the national budget.
He called for nationwide crypto rules, transparent exchanges and legal crypto ATMs.

Tuleushin said crypto mining firms could play a key role in modernizing the nation‚Äôs energy infrastructure. He noted that, similar to the United States, miners in Kazakhstan could help balance the power grid by consuming surplus energy.
Through the 70/30 energy initiative, foreign investors fund thermal power upgrades, with 70% of the generated capacity going to the national grid and 30% allocated to miners.
He also proposed utilizing associated petroleum gas from oil fields to power data centers, reducing emissions while generating revenue for oil producers.
Kazakhstan‚Äôs crypto mining sector has already contributed $34.6 million in taxes over the past three years. As of 2023, the government registered 415,000 mining machines, issued 84 licenses, and accredited five mining pools, Tuleushin said.
Crypto trading on the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC) exchange surged from $324 million in 2023 to $1.4 billion in 2024. From 2025, miners will be required to sell 75% of their mined assets via AIFC platforms.

Despite progress, crypto transactions remain largely unregulated outside the AIFC, with an estimated $4.1 billion in turnover in 2023, 91.5% of which took place beyond government oversight.
Authorities shut down 36 illegal exchanges in 2024, freezing $4.8 million in assets and disrupting two Ponzi schemes.
The country is also building an in-house central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital tenge. Development began in February 2023, with an¬†initial launch set for 2025.
Aside from Kazakhstan, other Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have also taken a friendly approach toward the digital asset industry.
On May 7, Binance signed a memorandum of understanding¬†(MOU) with Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs National Agency for Investments to introduce crypto payment infrastructure and blockchain education in the country.

51ec2929cad186d5d5199c99c9a80623,Cointelegraph,"Asia‚Äôs wealthy shifting from US dollar to crypto, gold, China: UBS",https://cointelegraph.com/news/ubs-asia-wealthy-invest-bitcoin-gold-china-dollar-diversification," Banking giant UBS says its high-net-worth clients in Asia are pivoting from US dollar assets toward gold, crypto and Chinese markets. 
High-net-worth clients across Asia are gradually pivoting away from US dollar-based investments, favoring gold, cryptocurrencies and Chinese assets instead, according to financial services giant UBS Group.
‚ÄúGold is getting very popular,‚Äù Amy Lo, the Swiss bank‚Äôs co-head of wealth management for Asia, said during Bloomberg‚Äôs New Voices event held in Hong Kong on May 13.
She cited rising geopolitical uncertainty and persistent market volatility as primary factors behind the shift. Investors, traditionally concentrated in US-centric assets, are now seeking broader exposure across alternative asset classes, including crypto, commodities and other currencies.
Lo said ‚Äúvolatility is definitely here to stay,‚Äù prompting clients to rebalance toward perceived safe havens and growth opportunities in new regions.
China, after years of muted interest, is also regaining traction among the ultra-wealthy. Lo noted that clients who previously avoided exposure to China are now proactively asking about investment opportunities.
Hong Kong‚Äôs benchmark index, heavily composed of Chinese companies, has emerged as one of the world‚Äôs top performers in 2024, further fueling interest.
Bank of America‚Äôs latest fund manager survey also shows that global fund managers significantly reduced their exposure to the US dollar in May, marking the largest underweight position in 19 years.

Christina Au-Yeung, head of Investment Management Services at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management Asia, told Bloomberg that a recent tariff truce between the US and China has created renewed investor optimism.
‚ÄúWe are seeing an emergence of really interesting themes coming back out in China,‚Äù she said.
Au-Yeung also pointed to a growing risk-aware mindset among Asia‚Äôs wealthiest clients. The firm now recommends a balanced portfolio allocation, including 40% fixed income, 40% equities, 15% alternatives and the remainder in cash or equivalents.
On May 11, the US and China announced an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs on each other‚Äôs goods. As per the deal, the US will lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on American goods from 125% to 10%.

In a recent note, Galaxy Digital analysts said Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a digital store of value, noting growing interest from institutions, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and even governments.
‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs supply and demand dynamics are solidifying its place as a mature digital store of value,‚Äù said Ian Kolman, co-portfolio manager at Galaxy.
Supporting this view, BlackRock‚Äôs head of thematics and active ETFs, Jay Jacobs, noted on April 25 that nations are increasingly diversifying away from US dollar reserves, turning instead to assets like gold ‚Äî and now, Bitcoin (BTC) ‚Äî as part of a broader shift in reserve strategy.

b332ef94c27cb2e043df4eaea25fd2e0,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin miners halt sales as BTC gains 20% since hash ribbon ‚Äòbuy‚Äô signal,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miners-halt-sales-btc-gains-20-hash-ribbon-buy-signal," Bitcoin miners may be reversing a lengthy selling trend that has become more intense since late 2023, recent data shows. 
Key points:
Bitcoin miners have stopped selling their BTC in what may signal the end of a lengthy distribution streak.
Over the past month, miner wallet balances have increased by around 2,700 BTC.
Hash Ribbons data shows good times continuing for both miners and BTC price strength.
Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation by miners is back as network participants swap selling for hodling at $75,000 lows.
Data from onchain analytics firm Glassnode shows that miners are now actively adding to their BTC reserves.
Bitcoin hitting multimonth lows in April sparked a sea change in miner behavior, with a lengthy selling streak reversing into significant accumulation.
Glassnode shows that shortly after BTC/USD bottomed just below $75,000, the balance in miner wallets itself found a floor, only to then start increasing along with price.
Miner wallets held 1,794,622 BTC on April 12, while as of May 13, they had reached 1,797,330 BTC ‚Äî an increase of 2,708 BTC or 0.15%.
While minimal in terms of total miner holdings, the turnaround is conspicuous as it follows a run of selling that initially gained momentum in late 2023. This, in turn, has led to optimism over the BTC price trajectory.¬†
‚ÄúExtremely bullish for Bitcoin!‚Äù trader and investor Mister Crypto summarized in a reaction on X, referencing similar data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant.

Earlier, Cointelegraph reported on decreasing miner sell-side pressure helping contribute to price trend, with institutional buy volumes dwarfing the amount of mined BTC per day.
A classic metric covering miner behavior continues to display classic performance since its latest ‚Äúbuy‚Äù signal.

Hash Ribbons, created by quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, uses two moving averages of hashrate to delineate periods of ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù among miners.
Since offering its last market entry tip in late March, BTC/USD has gained around 20%.
‚ÄúThe hash ribbons are still flashing a buy signal here,‚Äù Mister Crypto commented in a post on the phenomenon this week, predicting BTC price to ‚Äúgo much higher in May.‚Äù

Global bank Standard Chartered has beefed up its banking support to the cryptocurrency industry by inking a new partnership with the crypto prime broker FalconX.
Standard Chartered will provide a comprehensive suite of banking services to FalconX‚Äôs global institutional clients following the strategic partnership announced on May 14.
As part of the collaboration, FalconX will initially integrate Standard Chartered‚Äôs banking infrastructure and access to a range of diverse currency pairs for its institutional clients.
The partnership ultimately aims to include a broader range of offerings and mutual opportunities, the announcement noted.
The partnership is expected to ‚Äúexpand beyond banking‚Äù into additional products and services designed to meet evolving crypto demand from both FalconX and Standard Chartered‚Äôs institutional clients.
The joint services will target a broad range of clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, token issuers and payment platforms, the companies said.
Matt Long, FalconX‚Äôs general manager of APAC and Middle East, referred to Standard Chartered as ‚Äúone of the most forward-thinking global banks in digital asset adoption.‚Äù
‚ÄúAt FalconX, we support trading and financing for some of the world‚Äôs largest institutions in digital asset markets, and this relationship strengthens our ability to deliver robust banking and FX solutions to clients who rely on us to operate in crypto markets,‚Äù he said.
Standard Chartered‚Äôs collaboration with FalconX underscores the bank‚Äôs dedication to improving the digital asset ecosystem, said Luke Boland, the bank‚Äôs South Asia head of fintech.
‚ÄúAs institutional demand for digital assets continues to grow, we‚Äôre proud to provide the banking infrastructure that enables firms like FalconX to deliver world-class trading and financing solutions to institutional clients,‚Äù Boland stated in the announcement.
Standard Chartered‚Äôs latest crypto move comes as yet another effort by the bank to provide banking services to the crypto industry.

In April, Standard Chartered partnered with major crypto exchange OKX to pilot cryptocurrency and tokenized fund collateral to institutional investors.
The bank‚Äôs involvement in the cryptocurrency industry dates back to 2016, when Standard Chartered made a strategic investment in Ripple, the company behind the XRP (XRP) cryptocurrency.
The growing banking commitment to crypto comes in line with expectations of executives at industry firms including Messari and Sygnum Bank, who predicted a global banking push into Bitcoin (BTC) in the second half of 2025 amid favorable regulatory developments.
