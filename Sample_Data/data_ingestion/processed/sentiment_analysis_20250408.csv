26837b4d1a85b91f32a670c9c4a0743b,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin price retakes $80K as US stocks avoid 'Black Monday' meltdown,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-retakes-80-k-as-us-stocks-avoid-black-monday-meltdown," Bitcoin appears to find its footing, rallying above $80,000 and copying stocks by bouncing back from its initial tariff-induced losses. 
Bitcoin (BTC) sought a relief rally into the April 7 Wall Street open as US stocks rebounded from a 4%+ loss.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed the area around $80,000 forming a focus for BTC/USD after the pair hit five-month lows.
The fallout from US trade tariffs continued to ricochet across global markets, with Asia stocks closing the day with considerable losses.
At the same time, reports of a potential 90-day pause in the tariffs going live, against a background of negotiations with over 50 US trading partners, helped pare losses in futures markets ahead of the open and allowed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index to avert a ”Black Monday” 1987-style implosion.
“Nasdaq futures were down nearly -7% at their lowest point last night,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter noted in part of ongoing coverage on X.
Kobeissi nonetheless acknowledged that the S&P 500 had fallen more than 20% from its February all-time highs, opening in “bear market territory” for the first time since 2022.

Continuing, trading firm QCP Capital called international engagement over tariffs “remarkable.”
“Yet as the world scrambles to secure a seat at the table, markets are likely to remain on edge,” it concluded in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers.

Data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool continued to show shifting market expectations on interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, with the upcoming meeting in June now favored as a deadline.
Bitcoin meanwhile attempted to solidify support in the mid-$70,000 range, having come within spitting distance of old all-time highs from March 2024.

In its latest observations, onchain analytics firm Glassnode revealed the lows coinciding with the realized price of large tranches of the BTC supply.
“For now, $BTC seems to have found support at $74K. This aligns with the first major supply cluster below $80K - over 50K $BTC at $74.2K,” it reported on X.

Glassnode added that between the lows and $70,000 was another 175,000 BTC of “cost basis clusters.”
“The single largest level within this range is $71.6k, holding ~41k $BTC. The next more substantial support sits at $69.9k, where ~68k $BTC are held,” it confirmed.
As Cointelegraph reported, $69,000 and the area nearby is seen as a reliable long-term BTC price support zone which is statistically unlikely to break down.

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

Michael Saylor’s firm Strategy, the world’s largest publicly listed corporate holder of Bitcoin, did not add to its BTC holdings last week as the cryptocurrency’s price dropped below $87,000.
In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on April 7, Strategy announced it made no Bitcoin (BTC) purchases during the week of March 31 to April 6.
The decision followed a week of heightened market volatility, with BTC surging to as high as $87,000 on April 2 after starting the week at around $82,000, according to data from CoinGecko.

BTC fell below $80,000 on April 6, a significant discount from the average BTC price of Strategy’s previous 22,000 BTC purchase announced on March 31.
In the period from March 31 to April 6, Strategy also did not sell any shares of class A common stock, which it tends to use for financing its Bitcoin buys, the filing stated.
As of April 7, Strategy held an aggregate amount of 528,185 Bitcoin bought at $35.6 billion, or at an average price of 67,458 per BTC, it added.
An excerpt from Strategy’s Form 8-K report. Source: SEC
“Our unrealized loss on digital assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, was $5.91 billion, which we expect will result in a net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, partially offset by a related income tax benefit of $1.69 billion,” the filing added.
While Strategy avoided buying Bitcoin last week, its co-founder and former CEO, Saylor, continued posting about the crypto asset’s superiority on social media.
“Bitcoin is most volatile because it is most useful,” Saylor wrote in an X post on April 3, soon after BTC tumbled from the intra-week high of $87,100 on April 2 below $82,000, following the tariffs announcement by US President Donald Trump.

“Today’s market reaction to tariffs is a reminder: inflation is just the tip of the iceberg,” Saylor wrote in another X post.
“Capital faces dilution from taxes, regulation, competition, obsolescence, and unforeseen events. Bitcoin offers resilience in a world full of hidden risks,” he added.

US federal agencies are expected to disclose their cryptocurrency holdings to the Department of the Treasury by April 7, following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.
Citing an unidentified White House official, journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that the deadline for federal agencies to report their crypto holdings to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is April 7. 
The disclosures will remain confidential for now. “Unclear as of now if and when the findings could be made public,” Terrett wrote.

The reporting requirement followed an executive order signed on March 7 that directed the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile. The Bitcoin (BTC) reserve will be seeded with BTC forfeited to federal agencies through civil or criminal asset seizures.
White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks described the reserve as a “digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency,” saying that the US will not sell any BTC held in the reserve. “It will be kept as a store of value,” Sacks added. 
Sacks previously lamented the US government’s sales of 195,000 BTC for $366 million. The official said the BTC sold by the US government could’ve gone for billions if it had only held on to the assets. 
The reserve will initially be seeded by the BTC kept by the Treasury, while the other federal agencies will “evaluate their legal authority” to transfer their BTC into the reserve. 
Regarding the digital asset stockpile, Sacks said it would promote “responsible stewardship” of the government’s crypto assets under the Treasury. This includes potential sales from the stockpiles. 
On March 2, Trump said that the crypto reserve would include assets like XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). The president later added Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) to his crypto reserves list.

While Trump’s election may have positively impacted crypto markets, the US president’s next move has resulted in a market crash. 
On April 5, the Trump administration hit all countries with a 10% tariff. Some countries were given higher rates, including China at 34% and Japan at 24%. The European Union was also hit with a 20% tariff.  
Following Trump’s move, the overall crypto market capitalization declined by over 8%, slipping to $2.5 trillion.

The Mantra blockchain network has launched a $108,888,888 ecosystem fund aimed at accelerating the growth of startups focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi), amid rising demand for stable, asset-backed digital products.
Mantra, a layer-1 (L1) blockchain built for tokenized RWAs, launched the Mantra Ecosystem Fund (MEF) to accelerate the growth and adoption of projects and startups building on its network, according to an April 7 announcement shared with Cointelegraph.
Mantra said it will deploy the capital over the next four years among “high-potential blockchain projects” worldwide, with investment opportunities sourced through Mantra’s network of partners. The fund’s backers include a wide range of institutional partners including Laser Digital, Shorooq, Brevan Howard Digital, Valor Capital, Three Point Capital and Amber Group.

Mantra CEO John Patrick Mullin said the fund will operate an “open-arms policy, welcoming projects at any developmental stage globally with a particular focus on RWA’s and DeFi.” Mullin told Cointelegraph:

The launch of the fund comes a month after Mantra became the first DeFi platform to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license under Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).

The timing of the fund’s launch aligns with growing institutional interest in RWAs, which are seen by some as a hedge against crypto market volatility and broader economic uncertainty.
Global fears and uncertainty around US President Donald Trump’s tariffs have impacted investor sentiment across markets.
Despite a broader market slump triggered by US tariff-related concerns, the value of tokenized RWAs recently surged to a record high. According to data from RWA.xyz, total RWA market capitalization reached more than $19.6 billion as of early April, up from $17 billion in early February.

Industry watchers previously told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin’s lack of upside momentum may drive RWAs to a $50 billion all-time high before the end of 2025.
The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has also signaled support for the RWA space.

Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw renewed outflows last week, with $240 million in investor capital pulled, according to an April 7 report from digital asset manager CoinShares.
The outflows reversed two consecutive weeks of inflows that totaled $870 million, leaving total digital asset ETP holdings at about $133 billion, CoinShares reported.
The new outflows likely reflect investor caution in response to global trade tariffs imposed by the United States and concerns over their potential threat to global economic growth, CoinShares head of research James Butterfill said.

Bitcoin (BTC) ETPs led the downturn, with $207 million in weekly outflows. As a result, monthly flows turned negative for the first time this year, with $138 million in net outflows in the past 30 days.
Despite monthly outflows turning red, Bitcoin ETPs still maintain a significant amount of inflows year-to-date, totaling $1.3 billion, according to CoinShares data.

Ether (ETH)-linked ETPs also saw $38 million in weekly outflows but continued to hold $279 million in YTD inflows.
Multi-asset ETPs and short Bitcoin ETPs saw $144 million and $26 billion in YTD outflows, respectively, despite minor inflows last week.
Cryptocurrency ETPs by major crypto investment firm Grayscale Investments led the losses among issuers last week, with $95 million withdrawn from its products.
Grayscale’s year-to-date outflows now stand at $1.4 billion, the highest among all ETP providers tracked, according to CoinShares data.

Meanwhile, iShares ETFs by BlackRock still maintained $3.2 billion in YTD inflows after seeing $56 million in outflows last week.

Will 2021 prices return? 
Bitcoin (BTC) is turning back the clock this week as tariff mayhem drags BTC price action toward 2021.
Bitcoin is giving up bull market support lines left and right as a new “death cross” completes on the BTC/USD daily chart.
CPI week is firmly overshadowed by US trade tariffs and their increasingly global impact on stock markets.
Both crypto and TradFi market participants are drawing comparisons to “Black Monday” 1987 and the COVID-19 cross-market crash.
Bitcoin’s speculative investor base is firmly out of pocket and likely increasingly tempted to panic sell.
Sentiment everywhere is nonexistent, with the TradFi Fear & Greed Index recording its lowest score in history.

After slipping below $75,000 for the first time since November, BTC/USD is rapidly reawakening long-forgotten bull market support lines. These include $69,000, a level that first appeared in 2021.
The dive, which came as a copycat move several days after stock markets began to suffer major losses, caught many by surprise.

Among the trend lines now lost as support is the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) at around $77,000.
In an X thread on the coming week, trader CrypNuevo described price violating that level as the “only short triggerr I’ll be paying attention to.”
“If we drop below support and get back above it, then I’ll consider this as a deviation and that will be my long trigger fo a push up back to $87k,” he wrote.

“The momentum carrying through that Death Cross, puts BTC at a critical macro support test,” it told X followers.

Like last week, US trade tariffs are the major talking point across financial markets worldwide.
The impact of measures announced last week continues to be felt, as downside momentum on risk assets now becomes fueled by the prospect of more tariffs set for release on April 9.
Speaking to mainstream media over the weekend, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that the US government would go ahead with the measures without delay.
“The tariffs are coming,” he told CBS News.
With sentiment diving and panic among market participants from trading desks to hedge funds, little attention is paid to the week’s other potential volatility catalysts.
These will come in the form of US inflation data, itself a key topic as tariffs risk causing unexpected price growth.
The March prints of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) are due on April 10 and 11, respectively.
Previously, Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said that while tariffs would have a palpable effect on the US inflation battle, it would be difficult to assess this accurately in advance.
“As the new policies and their likely economic effects become clear, we will have a better sense of the implications for the economy and for monetary policy,” he subsequently said during a speech last week.

Market expectations of the Fed easing policy to compensate for the tariffs are clearly reflected in interest rate forecasts.
The latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool now shows that consensus favors a 0.25% rate cut at the Fed’s May meeting — sooner than the June deadline assumed until this weekend.
In informal circles, including social media and prediction platforms such as Polymarket, bets of an “emergency” rate cut coming sooner are rising rapidly.
“The Federal Reserve may have to make an emergency rate cut soon,” Professional Capital Management founder and CEO Anthony Pompliano predicted at the weekend.

In the short term, the “effects” of tariffs are feared to include a marketwide crash similar to “Black Monday” in 1987. 
As Cointelegraph reported, market responses to the first round of reciprocal tariffs laid the foundations for turmoil at the upcoming Wall Street open.
A 10% dip in two consecutive days has only happened for the fourth time in history.October 1987.October 2008.March 2020.April 2025.In 1987 & 2020, it marked the bottom.In 2008, it took one more month to mark the bottom.
For trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe, crypto’s Black Monday moment is already here.
“I think we’ll see a rollercoaster 1-2 weeks in which we’re having a test of the lows for Bitcoin. It can go as deep as $70K from here,” he warned X followers on April 7.

Trading resource The Kobeissi Letter pointed to heavy losses in both Chinese and Japanese stocks during the week’s first Asia trading session.
“We are seeing the market’s first circuit breakers since March 2020,” it reported.
Kobeissi described market sentiment as “polarized,” drawing multiple comparisons to the COVID-19 cross-market crash in March 2020 and beyond.
“This is by far the most panic we have seen in the market since March 2020. In fact, we may be nearing investor panic levels ABOVE March 2020,” it added. 
On Bitcoin, the investor cohort likely first to capitulate are short-term holders (STHs), the market’s more speculative entities with a buy-in date within the last six months.
As Cointelegraph reported, these investors are highly sensitive to BTC price volatility, and that their panic selling creates a vicious circle for the market.
Data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant now shows that the STH cohort is falling increasingly into the red.
The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric, which tracks STH coins moving in profit or loss, is currently below breakeven.
“When STH-SOPR falls below 1.0, it reflects that short-term investors are realizing losses — a classic signal of capitulation,” CryptoQuant contributor Yonsei Dent noted in one of its “Quicktake” blog posts.

Below $80,000, BTC/USD is now comfortably under the aggregate cost basis for STH investors, CryptoQuant confirms.

In a sobering yet arguably bizarre move, the extent of bearish sentiment on traditional markets, as measured by the Fear & Greed Index, has fallen to extremes.

Beyond the panic, some voices are cautiously hinting that now is an ideal moment to “buy the dip,” whether on stocks or crypto.
“This doesn’t necessarily mean the absolute bottom is in, but is generally at least a local opportunity,” Charles Edwards, the founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, argued in an X thread.
Edwards tallied up both bullish and bearish arguments, and concluded that much risk remained, especially to Bitcoin’s bull market.
“To be fair Bitcoin did very well last week, but has played catch up (to the downside) over the weekend. Pending some large unforeseen news, it’s going to be hard for Bitcoin to fight a correlation=1 event across risk assets, we saw something similar in early 2020,” he commented.

8d5fef0cd816ea33ea9ed6f70d5bf498,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin hashrate tops 1 Zetahash in historic first, trackers show",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hashrate-one-zetahash-first-time-ever," The Bitcoin network rate briefly soared above 1 Zetahash per second, multiple data sources show, making it one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. 
The Bitcoin network hashrate has topped 1 Zetahash per second (ZH/s) for the first time in Bitcoin’s 16-year history, according to several blockchain data sources.
Bitcoin’s hashrate crossed the milestone on April 5 at a peak of 1.025 ZH/s, according to mempool.space data, while BTC Frame data said it hit 1.02 ZH/s a day earlier.
Data from Coinwarz says that Bitcoin hashrate soared to as high as 1.1 ZH/s on April 4 at block height 890,915 — however, the same data indicates that Bitcoin first crossed 1 ZH/s on March 24.

The differences result from the varying approaches used to calculate hashrate — such as when block times and difficulty adjustments are measured, which Bitcoin nodes and miner pools are used to pull data from and more.
Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp also previously pointed out that estimating Bitcoin’s hashrate with one “trailing block” as opposed to five can result in a difference of over 0.04 ZH/s.
“Viewing the raw Hashrate metric can be deceiving due to random variations in block times,” added Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew, who pointed out that Bitcoin’s 30-day moving average hashrate is still around 0.845 ZH/s mark in a note to Cointelegraph.
Despite the discrepancies, the feat highlights the massive amount of computational power and increasing decentralization of the Bitcoin network, making it more secure than ever and significantly reducing the likelihood of a 51% attack.
The Bitcoin network’s reported rise to 1 ZH/s — equivalent to 1,000 Exahashes per second — marks a 1,000x increase since late January 2016, when Bitcoin first hit 1 EH/s for the first time. 
The second-largest proof-of-work crypto network, Litecoin, currently boasts a hashrate of 2.49 Petahashes per second according to Coinwarz — making it around 40,000 times less computationally powerful than Bitcoin.

Askew noted that the huge rise in hashrate has coincided with more commercial Bitcoin mining firms competing to solve Bitcoin blocks in recent years.
“Miners are doubling down: expanding sites and plugging in more efficient machines,” Askew said, adding that less efficient miners could soon be washed out unless Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rallies again in the coming months.
MARA Holdings is the largest Bitcoin miner with more than 50 EH/s of compute power, while the largest share of hashrate is channeled to Bitcoin mining pools Foundry USA Pool and AntPool, according to the Hashrate Index.

At least 24 publicly listed Bitcoin companies have machines set up to mine Bitcoin, according to CompaniesMarketCap.com. 
Among the other large miners contributing hashrate are Riot Platforms, Core Scientific, CleanSpark, Hut 8 Mining and TeraWulf.
The new all-time high in Bitcoin hashrate came in the middle of a sharp market downturn — with Bitcoin (BTC) falling nearly 10% over the last four days to $78,750, while US stocks saw an estimated $6.6 trillion loss on April 3 and 4 — the largest two-day loss ever.
Much of the fall has been attributed to US President Donald Trump’s tariff plans, which many industry analysts say are sparking recession fears.

Cryptocurrency prices tumbled as the US stock futures market opened sharply lower on April 6 as the Trump administration doubled down on its global tariff strategy.
The Trump administration hit all countries with a 10% tariff starting April 5, with some slapped at higher rates, including China at 34%, the European Union at 20%, and Japan at 24%.
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped over 6% in the last 24 hours and was trading around $77,883. Meanwhile, Ether (ETH) shed over 12% in the same time frame and was trading at $1,575, according to CoinGecko. The total crypto market cap dropped over 8% to $2.5 trillion. 
Prices have clawed back some losses since. Bitcoin has recovered 1.4% to $78,500. Meanwhile, Ether regained $1,594.

At the same time, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, returned a score of 23 in its latest April 7 update, which is considered extreme fear.
In a statement, Charlie Sherry, head of finance at Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said the drop is unsurprising because global markets are generally more illiquid on Sundays. 
“As a result, a few large sell-offs can have a disproportionate impact, pushing prices down quickly,” he said. 
Some traders, however, predict a Bitcoin breakout could be around the corner. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has also speculated that while the tariffs are rattling markets, they could result in a Bitcoin rally. 
The US Stock Futures market has also opened down. 
Futures tied to the S&P 500 dropped nearly 4%, according to Google Finance. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank by over 8%. 
Trading resource the Kobeissi Letter said in an April 6 post to X that the drop in US stock market futures puts S&P 500 futures in ”bear market territory,” adding that the US stock market has now erased an average of $400 billion per trading day for the last 32 days.

Tom Dunleavy, a managing partner at venture capital firm MV Global, said it could be the “worst three-day move for US stocks of all time” if “tonight’s futures hold.” 
Crypto-friendly billionaire investor Bill Ackman speculates that US President Donald Trump could postpone the tariffs to allow countries to make counteroffers or deals.
In an April 6 statement on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump doubled down on the tariffs, saying the US has massive financial deficits with China, the European Union and many others, which the levies will solve.

“The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing tens of billions of dollars into the USA. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold,” he said.
He also told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wasn't intentionally trying to cause a market sell-off but added that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” 
At the same time, US National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said in an April 6 interview with ABC's This Week program that more than 50 countries have reached out to the president to negotiate fresh trade deals.
“They’re doing that because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariff,” he said. 
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged US trading partners in an April 2 interview with Bloomberg against taking retaliatory steps, arguing “this is the high end of the number” for tariffs if they don't try to add more levies in response.

6df007931e01b2292542278dd71be1a2,Cointelegraph,Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacks,https://cointelegraph.com/news/jameson-lopp-sounds-alarm-bitcoin-address-poisoning," The cypherpunk and crypto executive cautioned Bitcoin holders to remain vigilant and always thoroughly review destination addresses. 
Jameson Lopp, the chief security officer at Bitcoin (BTC) custody company Casa, sounded the alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacks, a social engineering scam that uses similar addresses from a victim's transaction history to fool them into sending funds to the malicious address.
According to Lopp's Feb 6 article, the threat actors generate BTC addresses that match the first and last digits of addresses from the victim's transaction history. Lopp analyzed the Bitcoin blockchain history for this type of attack and found:
""Over these 18 months, just shy of 48,000 transactions were sent that match this profile of potential address poisoning,"" Lopp added.

The executive urged Bitcoin holders to thoroughly check addresses before sending funds and called for better wallet interfaces that fully display addresses. Lopp's warning highlights the emerging cybersecurity exploits and fraudulent schemes plaguing the industry.

According to cybersecurity firm Cyvers, over $1.2 million was stolen through address poisoning attacks in March 2025. Cyvers CEO Deddy Lavid said these types of attacks cost users $1.8 million in February.
Blockchain security firm PeckShield estimates the total amount lost to crypto hacks in Q1 2025 to be over $1.6 billion, with the Bybit hack accounting for the vast majority of the stolen funds.
The Bybit hack in February was responsible for $1.4 billion in losses and represents the biggest crypto hack in history.
Cybersecurity experts have tied the attacks to North Korean state-affiliated hackers that use complex and evolving social engineering schemes to steal cryptocurrencies and sensitive data from targets.
Common Lazarus Group social engineering scams include fraudulent job offers, zoom meetings with fake venture capitalists, and phishing scams on social media.
