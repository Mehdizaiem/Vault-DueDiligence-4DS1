China’s response to America’s sweeping trade tariffs could result in capital flight to Bitcoin and crypto, according to BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes.
“If not the Fed [Federal Reserve], then the PBOC [People’s Bank of China] will give us the Yahtzee ingredients,” said Hayes on X on April 8 in reference to the catalyst needed to resume the crypto market bull run.
Hayes said that if the Chinese central bank devalued its currency, the yuan, the “narrative [is] that Chinese capital flight will flow into Bitcoin,” adding that “it worked in 2013, 2015, and can work in 2025.” 
Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou said that China will try to lower the yuan to counter the tariff, adding that historically, whenever the yuan drops, “a lot of Chinese capital flows into BTC,” which is bullish for Bitcoin (BTC).

China devalued the yuan by nearly 2% against the US dollar, which saw the largest single-day drop in decades in August 2015. Bitcoin did see some increased interest during this period, though the direct causative relationship is debated.
When the yuan fell below the symbolic 7:1 ratio against the USD in August 2019, Bitcoin also saw price increases in the same timeframe. Some analysts suggested that Chinese investors were using Bitcoin as a hedge as the asset jumped 20% in the first week of that month. 
In 2019, crypto asset manager Grayscale noted the depreciation in the Chinese yuan at attributed it as a factor that spurred Bitcoin markets at the time. 
Wealthy Chinese citizens may have used crypto in the past to preserve their wealth, move it beyond government reach, and avoid capital controls and restrictions within the country, according to analysts. 
It is also believed that currency devaluations also damage trust in central banks and government financial management, pushing people toward decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin.

On April 7, the US president vowed to ratchet up additional tariffs against China, which responded by stating it “will fight to the end.”
“If the US implements escalated tariff measures, China will resolutely take countermeasures to defend its own interests,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement.

Recent fake news that US President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day pause in tariffs shows the potential for a strong market rebound should a real one take place, according to observers. 
A fake news post on X on April 7 from the verified “Walter Bloomberg” account claimed that the White House was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs following an interview with Kevin Hassett, one of Donald Trump’s economic advisers. 
“Hassett: Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except China,” read the now-deleted post from the user, who is not affiliated with Bloomberg News. 
The account, which has a verified badge and 852,000 followers, caused quite a stir after the rumor was mistakenly aired as a banner on CNBC and then amplified by Reuters.
The S&P 500 spiked more than 8% from its low on the day in reaction, the Nasdaq added 9.5% in less than an hour and the Dow Jones pumped 7%, adding trillions to stock markets. 
Bitcoin (BTC) prices saw a similar spike, with the asset pumping 6.5% to top $80,000 briefly before falling back again. 
The official White House “Rapid Response” account quickly posted on X that this was fake news, and markets began to dump again. 
While the rumor was debunked as fake, crypto YouTuber Lark Davis said that the episode revealed some critical things about the market. 
The market is ready to accept prolonged China negotiations as long as most deals can be resolved, he said before adding the “market is ready to ape, even a lame 90-day delay sent markets soaring.”  
“Now imagine what happens when dozens of deals are made with top players ie, India, Canada, and the UK. Shit tons of money is on the sidelines, ready to ape in at a moment's notice.”
“That fake headline might actually give Trump, Navarro, and Lutnick more confidence to keep pushing this further,” commented X user Geiger Capital, who added, “They now know that at any point they can announce a pause and the market will rally ~10% in a single day.”
Fox News asked Hasset whether Trump would consider a 90-day pause in tariffs and was given a non-committal response. “I think the president is gonna decide what the president is gonna decide,” he said, adding: “Even if you think there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that’s still a small share of GDP.”

“The idea that it's going to be a nuclear winter or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric,” he said.

Shortly after the 90-day tariff pause post was deleted, Trump took to his own social media platform, Truth Social, to threaten China with even more tariffs. 
“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long-term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, the United States will impose additional tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” he said.

76759a2a2c66273534b21efe46327cfa,Cointelegraph,Lawyer sues US homeland dept to probe supposed Satoshi Nakamoto meeting,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-lawyer-sues-homeland-security-in-effort-unmask-satoshi," Crypto lawyer James Murphy has sued the US Department of Homeland Security to force the agency into disclosing whom it believes is Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. 
Update: April 8 at 1:01am UTC: This article has been updated to include James Murphy’s responses to two questions from Cointelegraph.
A crypto lawyer has sued the US Department of Homeland Security, alleging the agency may know who created Bitcoin — compelling the department to share what it knows. 
The Freedom of Information Act lawsuit was filed by James Murphy, who based his accusations on claims made by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud at a conference in April 2019, where she said a few of her colleagues had previously met with four people involved in creating Bitcoin.
“My FOIA lawsuit simply asks for the notes, email and other documents relating to that alleged interview,” Murphy posted to X after announcing the April 7 suit.  
“IF the interview really happened as the DHS Agent claimed, there should be documentation of the substance of that meeting,” added Murphy, who goes by MetaLawMan on X.
Source: James Murphy
Speaking at the OffshoreAlert Conference North America in Miami in April 2019, Saoud said DHS agents met with the four people it believed to have created Bitcoin, asking what their motives were and what the “end game” is for Bitcoin.
“The agents flew to California and they realized that he wasn’t alone in creating this, there were three other people, they sat down and talked with them to find out how this actually works and what the reason for it was,” Saoud said in the presentation, which is available on YouTube.
If the DHS resists disclosure, Murphy said he will “pursue the case to conclusion” to solve the mystery.
Murphy, however, noted that it is possible that Saoud and the other DHS agents were mistaken and did not interview the real Satoshi Nakamoto.

Murphy is being assisted by former Assistant US Attorney Brian Field, who specializes in Freedom of Information Act litigation.
The purpose of the Freedom of Information Act is to promote transparency and accountability by granting the public access to information held by the government.
Cointelegraph asked Murphy two questions about the DHS lawsuit. Here are his responses in full. 
Question #1: What is your gut feeling—do you think the DHS actually interviewed the real Satoshi?Answer: “I think it’s very possible that the DHS agent was mistaken in what she said at that conference. I think DHS agents may have met with bitcoin code maintainers, or with actual Satoshi imposters. But, who knows? The DHS agent was a pretty high ranking official and was in a position to know what she was talking about. Either way, I think it will be productive to find out and hopefully resolve this question. Nothing prevents DHS from voluntarily revealing the information without need for protracted litigation.”Question #2: If the agency did speak with the four creators — who may be ordinary US citizens — why do you believe revealing their identities serves the public interest, even if it could put their safety or privacy at risk?Answer: “I don’t understand the question. The identities of the creators of all of the largest blockchain projects, like Charles Hoskinson and Vitalik Buterin etc., are all well known in the crypto community. There are also many major figures like Michael Saylor, Tim Draper and others who have amassed enormous wealth through investment in bitcoin and their identities are well known.There are hundreds of documentaries on YouTube where amateur sleuths have tried to identify Satoshi. I’m not one of them. I’m not hiring investigators to try to track down Satoshi, I’m seeking government records under transparency laws in effect in the U.S. If DHS did, in fact, learn Satoshi’s identity, then I’m not sure what the rationale is for dozens of government employees to have this information but withhold it from the general public. Our government is required to be transparent and not keep secrets from the citizens, absent a legitimate national security concern or other limited exemption. We consider this a fundamental aspect of our freedom in the USA. It is why we have something called the “Freedom of Information Act.” Transparency is good, the government hiding information from the citizenry is generally bad.
I am open about the fact that I am pro-bitcoin, having been an investor in bitcoin and a bitcoin miner since 2017. I speak to groups of executives and policy makers about bitcoin and I advocate for bitcoin adoption. What I find when I give these talks is very often these audiences (who are new to bitcoin) struggle with the idea that the creator of bitcoin is unknown while the provenance of the other major crypto projects is (relatively) transparent.
So, my intention is to either conclusively refute the claim of the DHS agent that they interviewed Satoshi, or achieve some transparency that will open the door to greater bitcoin adoption in the U.S. and around the globe. I support President Trump’s initiatives to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Since the bitcoin code is open source and can only be changed through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) procedure, Satoshi (if he or they were identified) would have no ability to unilaterally affect changes to bitcoin. As a result, any revelation of Satoshi’s identity is unlikely to adversely impact bitcoin. It’s more likely that such transparency would be a net positive for growing bitcoin adoption. Others may have different views on that and I respect their opinions.”
The lawsuit follows a wave of recent efforts attempting to uncover Satoshi’s identity.Last October, a controversial HBO documentary claimed that Peter Todd, a Bitcoin cypherpunk, invented Bitcoin. Todd refuted that conclusion, and most industry pundits said HBO’s evidence was weak.
Nick Szabo, Adam Back and Hal Finney have also had their names tied to Satoshi’s identity. Szabo and Back regularly refute claims they’re Satoshi, as did Finney before he died in 2013.
Meanwhile, members of the Bitcoin community are split on whether unveiling Satoshi’s identity would be a net positive for Bitcoin.
Some worry that revealing Satoshi's identity could compromise Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos and put Satoshi’s safety at risk, while others want to be reassured that Bitcoin wasn’t created by the US government.

22b80ef9941a374bb731aed0d598dedc,Cointelegraph,How low can the Bitcoin price go?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-low-can-the-bitcoin-price-go," Analysts warn that Bitcoin is not in the clear yet, raising the chance of further price downside to the $60,000 level. 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a four-month low of $74,500 on April 7, and data suggests that the price may not have bottomed yet. 
Investors dumped risk assets after US President Donald Trump doubled down on his plan to impose global tariffs over the weekend, triggering a $9.5 trillion wipeout in global equity markets.

Growing calls for a US recession have spooked risk investors while leaving crypto market participants wondering how low can the Bitcoin price go in the near future.
Bitcoin is currently testing a critical technical level—the 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA)—which has historically acted as a dividing line between bull and bear phases. 
According to market analyst Ted Pillows and numerous other chartists, Bitcoin must reclaim the EMA, currently near $77,500, to avoid a deeper correction.

If BTC fails to close back above it, Pillows warns of a potential decline toward the $69,000–$70,000 range, which aligns with the 2021 cycle highs. A further drop to $67,000, the average entry-level of Strategy’s Michael Saylor, also remains a possibility.

Bitcoin appeared to have found short-term support at around $74,000, which corresponds to a notable cost-basis cluster where over 50,000 BTC are held. 
Glassnode’s UTXO realized price distribution (URPD) heatmap shows this is the first major cost-basis cluster below $80,000. These holders raised their average buy price until March 10, then stopped moving coins—showing confidence, not panic.

Investors hold around 175,000 BTC in the $74,000–$70,000 range, creating a strong buffer zone. The largest cluster sits at $71,600, with 41,000 BTC concentrated there, making it the likely next support if $74,000 breaks.

Meanwhile, Glassnode’s Short-Term Holder (STH) realized price bands place the current average STH cost basis at $89,000, with the -1 standard deviation band at $69,000.

This level has acted as a historical “max pain” zone for short-term investors during pullbacks in previous bull cycles, suggesting the $69,000 level is a floor where weak hands capitulate and long-term investors often step in.
Historical patterns reveal Bitcoin entering a prolonged bear market after breaking decisively below the 50-week EMA support. In most cases, such corrections have led the price toward the 200-week EMA, as shown in red circular areas below.

If the fractal analysis plays out as intended, Bitcoin’s price target in the event of a 50-week EMA breakdown appears to be around $50,000, aligning with the 200-week EMA’s current positioning.

c43f72eb84509cddc953e82486627eca,Cointelegraph,Here’s what happened in crypto today,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today," Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

Corporate Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries collectively shed more than $4 billion in value after US President Donald Trump’s tariffs triggered a global market sell-off, data shows. 
As of April 7, corporate Bitcoin holdings are worth approximately $54.5 billion in the aggregate, down from roughly $59 billion before April 2, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net.
The cryptocurrency’s volatility has also weighed on publicly traded Bitcoin holders’ share prices. 
The Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (OWNB) — an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking a diverse basket of corporate Bitcoin holders — has lost more than 13% since Trump announced sweeping US import tariffs on April 2, according to Yahoo Finance.
Even shares of Strategy — the de facto Bitcoin hedge fund founded by Michael Saylor that pioneered corporate Bitcoin buying — are down, clocking losses of more than 13% since April 2, Google Finance data showed. 
The losses highlight ongoing concerns about Bitcoin’s increasing popularity as a corporate treasury asset. Historically, corporate treasuries hold extremely low-risk assets like US Treasury Bills. 
“Cryptocurrencies' high volatility and uncertain regulatory landscape are misaligned with the fundamental goals of treasury management [such as] stability, liquidity, and capital preservation,” David Krause, a finance professor at Marquette University, said in a January research publication.

In 2024, surging Bitcoin prices pushed Strategy’s shares up more than 350%, according to data from FinanceCharts. 
Strategy’s success has inspired dozens of copycats, but investors are becoming skeptical.
In March, GameStop lost nearly $3 billion in market capitalization as shareholders second-guessed the videogame retailer’s plans to stockpile Bitcoin. 
“There are question marks with GameStop's model. If bitcoin is going to be the pivot, where does that leave everything else?” Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at eToro, told Reuters on March 27.

Still, adding Bitcoin to corporate treasuries can “potentially be a valuable hedge against growing fiscal deficits, currency debasement, and geopolitical risks,” asset manager Fidelity Digital Assets said in a 2024 report.
That thesis may already be playing out as Trump’s tariffs rattle markets, Binance said in an April 7 research report.  
“[I]n the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” Binance said.
Investors “will be watching closely to see if BTC is able to retain its appeal as a non-sovereign, permissionless asset in a protectionist global economy,” according to the report.

The cryptocurrency market erased all gains from President Trump’s US Crypto Strategic Reserve announcement, plunging by over 14.7% in seven days to reach $2.7 trillion on March 10.

Several factors have contributed to the latest drop in crypto prices, including:
Trump’s acknowledgement that his policies will cause short-term pain to the economy.
Investors are risk-off amid the continued outflows from crypto investment products.
TOTAL drops toward the technical target of a descending triangle.
President Trump’s recent statements have cast a shadow over the crypto market, tempering the enthusiasm that followed his pro-crypto rhetoric earlier in 2025. 
Key points:
Bitcoin  (BTC) declined 4% in the last 24 hours.
Ether (ETH) is down 3.2% over the last 24 hours to trade just above $2,000.
Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) have also recorded losses, down 7.2% and 4.5%, respectively.
Compounding the issue are the significant liquidations in the derivatives market. 
A total of $650.80 million in liquidations has been recorded in the past 24 hours.
Long positions took the hardest hit, with $595.75 million liquidated.

Bitcoin and Ethereum were the biggest casualties, with $264.22 million and $114.76 million in liquidations, respectively.
When long positions are liquidated, traders’ holdings are automatically sold, increasing market supply and driving prices lower.
More critically, US President Donald Trump acknowledged that markets could see short-term pain from his policies, including the trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China and budget-cutting plans.
“There could be a little disruption,"" said Trump in an interview with Fox News, adding:
The market, which surged post-election on hopes of a deregulated, crypto-friendly administration, is now grappling with the reality that Trump’s broader economic agenda may introduce headwinds before any crypto-specific benefits materialize.
The crypto market’s ongoing correction aligns with the huge capital outflows from crypto investment products. 
Key takeaways:
Digital asset investment products saw outflows for the fourth week in a row, totaling $876 million during the week ending March 7, as per CoinShares report.
This brings outflows to $4.75 billion in the last four weeks, reducing the year-to-date inflows to $2.6 billion.
This indicates institutional investors decreased their exposure to digital assets.
Bitcoin saw the biggest share of outflows, totaling $756 million.
Total assets under management have declined by $39 billion from their peak to the current value of $142 billion, the lowest point since mid-November 2024.

CoinShares head of research James Butterfill attributed this to “negative sentiment,” suggesting “capitulation” among investors.
Additionally, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plummeted to 10 on March 10, its lowest since July 2022, indicating “extreme fear.”

From a technical perspective, today’s crypto market’s decline is part of a correction trend that saw TOTAL—the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies—drop below a descending triangle pattern.
A descending triangle is a bearish continuation pattern, forming when the price makes lower highs while maintaining a flat support level at the bottom.
The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the support level with high volume and drops by as much as the triangle’s maximum height.
As of March 10, TOTAL had fallen to the pattern’s target of $2.6 trillion at the 50-weekly simple moving average (SMA).

If selling pressure persists, the 100–week SMA at $2 trillion could become the next downside target.
Holding the 50-week SMA as support may strengthen the ongoing rebound toward the pattern’s lower trendline, aligning with the $3.1 trillion level.

ab2fdf19d031b3b9eb66468782bc5690,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin on verge of largest ‘price drawdown’ of the bull market — Analyst,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-on-verge-of-largest-price-drawdown-of-the-bull-market-analyst," One analyst says Bitcoin price is close to locking in the deepest correction of this cycle, but how does it compare to previous bull and bear market drawdowns? 
Bitcoin’s (BTC) 26.62%  decline from its $109,500 all-time high is en route to becoming the deepest drawdown of the current bull market cycle, according to CryptoQuant head of research, Julio Moreno.

Bitcoin has experienced significant drawdowns in past cycles, with a notable 83% drop from its peak in 2018 and a 73% correction from all-time highs (ATH) in 2022. In comparison, the current decline of 26.62%, while substantial, remains less severe than previous bear markets. 
This suggests that even though the current downturn is impactful, it has not yet reached the intensity of previous cycles. However, crypto and macro resource ‘ecoinometrics’ said that Bitcoin might struggle to stage an immediate turnaround. The analysts explained,

With the Nasdaq 100 currently flat year-on-year, Bitcoin’s price recovery might be difficult, even if the correction halts.
The recent Bitcoin (BTC) price drop also put Michael Saylor’s Strategy on the defensive, with the firm opting not to purchase any BTC for its treasury between March 31 and April 6. 
Additionally, data from Strategytracker highlighted that the corporation spent $35.65 billion on its Bitcoin holdings, currently reflecting a mere 17% return on a five-year holding period.

On the weekly chart, Bitcoin tested the 50-weekly exponential moving average (blue indicator) for the first time since September 2024. A weekly close below the 50-W EMA has signaled the beginning of a bear market in previous market cycles.

The immediate point of interest below the current price remains at $74,000, which was the early 2024 all-time high. However, the daily demand zone between $65,000 and $69,000 could be a bigger liquidity level based on its significance. The $69,000 level is also the 2021 all-time high price. 
Additionally, Bitcoin’s weekly relative strength index, RSI, reached its lowest value of 43 since January 2023 at the end of Q1. In August 2023 and September 2024, the RSI recovered from a similar value to trigger a price recovery for Bitcoin. In 2022, when RSI dropped below 40, bears took total control of the market.

3a592b3e4fe5932cbd6f9bf3c67e4b2a,Cointelegraph,Crypto bull market ‘hasn't started yet’ — LONGITUDE panel,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-bull-market-hasnt-started-yet-longitude-panel," Messari CEO Eric Turner says the crypto bull market will ramp up in the third quarter of 2025. 
Crypto’s worst quarter since the FTX crisis has many investors worried about the end of the bull market, but according to an industry panel, Bitcoin and altcoins’ parabolic moves haven’t even begun yet. 
In a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event in Paris, France, MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said he thinks the bull market is “actually getting started from this point.” 
While it’s hard to believe that following Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent plunge below $80,000 on global tariff woes, “we know from history” that chaotic sell-offs create favorable conditions for a reversal, he said.
Van de Poppe drew parallels between the current market dump and the COVID-19 crash in 2020, when Bitcoin plunged by nearly 40% in a single day.
“That was the actual bottom, and since then, Bitcoin went 20x,” said van de Poppe.

Messari CEO Eric Turner agreed, saying, “We never had a bull market,” but rather “two sides of the market.” 
“We had Bitcoin where all the flows went into [exchange-traded funds]” and “then you have pockets of things,” such as the memecoin frenzy and other short-term trends, he said.
“I actually think the real question is, when does the bull market come? If you ask me, that’s going to be Q3, Q4 of this year,” said Turner.
Beyond short-term price action, it helps to look at the big picture, especially in the United States, said John Patrick Mullin, the co-founder and CEO of Mantra. Mullin said he’s “excited” about all of the favorable policy tailwinds coming from the United States, including the Executive Branch.

US President Donald Trump is overseeing an overhaul of crypto regulations in Washington, with lawmakers moving closer to passing landmark stablecoin and market structure bills. 
Trump has also appointed pro-crypto leaders to various positions, chief among them being Paul Atkins, who recently moved one step closer to securing the nomination as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
However, these positive developments have failed to kickstart the bull market or bring meaningful capital flows into the industry, largely because Trump’s other agenda items — namely, tackling perceived trade imbalances — have triggered growth fears. 
Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2 were perceived by many investors as an egregious attempt to rewrite the terms of global trade, as they went beyond the 10% universal tariff proposed initially.

The tariff announcement triggered the largest exodus from US stocks since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
However, if past crises like COVID-19 are anything to go by, the US Federal Reserve will likely step in at some point to backstop the market should things get progressively worse.
“[...] If you go back in time with another crisis and at some point the Fed steps in to lower the rates and to print money to stimulate the internal economy,” van de Poppe said during the panel discussion.
“So, it’s going to happen. The question is when,” said van de Poppe.

087626610bd7382d5f083aa002a3cd49,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, showing 'signs of resilience,' beats stocks, gold as equities fold — Binance",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-shows-signs-of-reslience-outperforms-stocks-gold-amid-global-market-selloff," While gold futures are down, the precious metal remains preferred over Bitcoin by fund managers as a safe-haven asset choice during times of uncertainty. 
Bitcoin (BTC) is showing “signs of resilience” even as stocks and the broader cryptocurrency market plunge amid a global market sell-off after US President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on US imports last week, Binance Research said. 
As of mid-day trading on April 7, Bitcoin is up almost 1% to nearly $79,000. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 — an index of large US stocks — is essentially flat and front-month gold futures are down around 1.5%, according to Google Finance.
“Even in the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, said in an April 7 research report.  
Notably, Bitcoin’s supply of long-term holders continues to rise, “reflecting conviction and limited capitulation during recent volatility,” Binance said.
On April 2, Trump said he was putting tariffs of at least 10% on most imports into the United States and adding additional ""reciprocal"" tariffs on goods from 57 countries. 
Since then, major US stock indexes — including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq — dropped by more than 10% as traders braced for a looming trade war. 
Bitcoin is still down more than stocks — about 12% — but has held up better than crypto’s overall market capitalization, which is down roughly 25% since April 2. 
“Now, with reciprocal tariffs emerging and global markets adjusting to the prospect of prolonged trade fragmentation, much could hinge on BTC’s ability to reassert its safe haven narrative,” the report said.

Bitcoin’s correlation with gold — historically considered the ultimate safe haven asset during times of extreme macroeconomic uncertainty — has been low, averaging around 0.12 over the past 90 days, Binance said. 
The cryptocurrency has a closer correlation with equities of 0.32. However, “despite short-term swings, BTC may still have room to reassert a more independent macro identity,” according to the exchange. 
“The key question is whether BTC can return to its long-term pattern of low correlation with equities,” noted the report.

For now, gold appears to be the preferred safe haven asset among fund managers, Binance said. 
It cited a survey in which 58% of respondents said they would prefer to hold gold during a trade war versus only 3% for Bitcoin. 
“Market participants will be watching closely to see if BTC is able to retain its appeal as a non-sovereign, permissionless asset in a protectionist global economy,” Binance said.
