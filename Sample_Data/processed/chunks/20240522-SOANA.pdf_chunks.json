Thus, \nregardless of the original amount of data or file size involved, its unique hash will always be the same size”.23 \nFor instance, using the SHA -256 hashing function 24 the hash of the sentence  “Hello, how are \nyou?” is “04cdee65fb33653432b0e56abd32c878f2a13286bfc6ddab85472fd3855d7f2e”, using the \nsame function, the hash of the entire section two of this chapter is \n“6cd947fa4ceda20591c14ce78f9d0f8af573fec5c5785975eca23676ea80d031”.",

To put it plainly, a hash can be described as a non-descriptive \nfixed length summary of a certain piece of information to which it is univocally linked. Even a \nslight modification of the source data will modify the connected hash. This guarantees that, as long \nas the hash is not modified, the underlying data is intact.

Let’s analyse a couple \nof them to better understand their functioning.188 \nFirst, multi-input heuristic.189 Multi-input clustering aims at connecting a group of addresses to a \nsingle entity. This is done by searching for multi -input transactions (meaning transactions where \nmultiple addresses are used for a single transaction). The addresses can then be clustered as \nassociated with one entity. 190 The basic idea being that, if two addresses are used for a single \ntransaction, then both are controlled by the same entity.

The DAO, if \ndecentralized, cannot be bent into doing anything that is not provided by its code.30 In this sense, \nit would be disproportionate to ask for compliance with anti -money laundering duties to parties \nthat miss the concrete code-given capacity to implement them. Hence, to apply compliance duties \nthe corresponding powers should already be provided by the code underlying the DAO.    \nLet’s give two examples to clarify.  \n \n28 D.A. Zetzsche - R.P.

DAOs are excluded from the regulatory purview and are not even \ncategorized as a separate entity under MiCaR. Throughout this chapter, we have underlined how \nthis approach seems to generate a lacuna, one that opens the way to legal uncertainty and criminal \nopportunities. However, as part of the MiCaR’s legislative process, a proposal for a more tailored \nstrategy to decentralized arrangements had surfaced.  \nThe first position (hereinafter Proposal) taken by the European Parliament on the MiCaR’s initial \ntext included a specific regulation for decentralized autonomous organizations.48 While this part \nof the Proposal has not been included in the final text, it represents an interesting example of the",
