Executive Summary  
In October 2018, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) adopted changes to its 
Recommendations to explicitly clarify that they apply to financial activities involving 
virtual assets; FATF also added two new definitions to the Glossary: “virtual asset” 
(VA) and “virtual asset service provider” (VASP). The amended FATF 
Recommendation 15 requires that VASPs be regulated for anti-money laundering and 
countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) purposes, that they be licensed or 
registered, and subject to effective systems for monitoring or supervision.  
In June 2019, the FATF adopted an Interpretive Note to Recommendation 15 to 
further clarify how the FATF requirements should apply in relation to VAs and VASPs, 
in particular with regard to the application of the risk-based approach to VA activities 
or operations and VASPs; supervision or monitoring of VASPs for AML/CFT purposes; 
licensing or registration; preventive measures, such as customer due diligence, 
recordkeeping, and suspicious transaction reporting, among others; sanctions and 
other enforcement measures; and international co-operation. 
The FATF also adopted a first version of this Guidance1 on the application of the risk-
based approach to VAs and VASPs in June 2019; the Guidance was updated in October 
2021. It is intended to both help national authorities in understanding and developing 
regulatory and supervisory responses to VA activities and VASPs, and to help private 
sector entities seeking to engage in VA activities, in understanding their AML/CFT 
obligations and how they can effectively comply with these requirements.  
This Guidance outlines the need for countries and VASPs, and other entities involved 
in VA activities, to understand the money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) 
risks associated with VA activities and to take appropriate mitigating measures to 
address those risks. In particular, the Guidance pro vides examples of risk indicators 
that should specifically be considered in a VA context, with an emphasis on factors 
that would further obfuscate transactions or inhibit VASPs’ ability to identify 
customers. 
The Guidance examines how VA activities and VASPs fall within the scope of the FATF 
Standards. It discusses the five types of activities covered by the VASP definition and 
provides examples of VA -related activities that would fall within the definition and 
also those that would potentially be excluded from the FATF scope. In that respect, it 
highlights the key elements required to qualify as a VASP, namely acting as a business 
for or on behalf of another person and providing or actively facilitating VA -related 
activities. 
The Guidance describes the appl ication of the FATF Recommendations to countries 
and competent authorities; as well as to VASPs and other obliged entities that engage 
in VA activities, including financial institutions such as banks and securities broker -
dealers, among others. Almost all of the FATF Recommendations are directly relevant 
to address the ML/TF risks associated with VAs and VASPs, while other 
Recommendations are less directly or explicitly linked to VAs or VASPs, though they 
are still relevant and applicable. VASPs therefore have the same full set of obligations 
as financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions.  
                                                      
1  This Guidance also updates the 2015 FATF Guidance for a Risk -Based Approach to Virtual 
Currencies.

The Guidance details the full range of obligations applicable to VASPs as well as to VAs 
under the FATF Recommendations, following a Re commendation-by-
Recommendation approach. This includes clarifying that all of the funds or value -
based terms in the FATF Recommendations ( e.g., “property,” “proceeds,” “funds,” 
“funds or other assets,” and other “corresponding value”) include VAs. Consequently, 
countries should apply all of the relevant measures under the FATF 
Recommendations to VAs, VA activities, and VASPs.  
The Guidance explains the VASP registration or licensing requirements, in particular 
how to determine in which country/ies VASPs should be registered or licensed – at a 
minimum where they were created; or in the jurisdiction where their business is 
located in cases where they are a natural person . However,  jurisdictions can also 
choose to require VASPs to be licensed or registered befo re conducting business in 
their jurisdiction or from their jurisdiction. The Guidance further underlines that 
national authorities are required to take action to identify natural or legal persons 
that carry out VA activities without the requisite license o r registration. This would 
be equally applicable to countries that have chosen to prohibit VA s and VA activities 
at the national level.  
Regarding VASP supervision, the Guidance makes clear that only competent 
authorities, and not self-regulatory bodies, can act as VASP supervisory or monitoring 
bodies. They should conduct risk -based supervision or monitoring, and have 
adequate powers, including to conduct inspections, compel the production of 
information and impose sanctions. There is a specific focus on t he importance of 
international co -operation between supervisors, given the cross -border nature of 
VASPs’ activities and provision of services. 
The Guidance makes clear that VASPs, and other entities involved in VA activities, 
need to apply all the preventive measures described in FATF Recommendations 10 to 
21. The Guidance explains how these obligations should be fulfilled in a VA context 
and provides clarifications regarding the specific requirements applicable to the 
USD/EUR 1  000 threshold for occasional  transactions, above which VASPs must 
conduct customer due diligence (Recommendation 10); and the obligation to obtain, 
hold, and transmit required originator and beneficiary information, immediately and 
securely, when conducting VA transfers (Recommendati on 16) (the ‘travel rule’). As 
the guidance makes clear, relevant authorities should co -ordinate to ensure this can 
be done in a way that is compatible with national data protection and privacy rules.   
Finally, the Guidance provides examples of jurisdicti onal approaches to regulating, 
supervising, and enforcing VA activities, VASPs, and other obliged entities for 
AML/CFT. 
In October 2021, this Guidance was updated to provide the public and private sectors 
with revised guidance. These revisions focused on s ix key areas where greater 
guidance from the FATF was sought. These are to (1) clarify the definitions of VA and 
VASP to make clear that these definitions are expansive and there should not be a case 
where a relevant financial asset is not covered by the FATF Standards (either as a VA 
or as another financial asset), (2) provide guidance on how the FATF Standards apply 
to stablecoins and clarify that a range of entities involved in stablecoin arrangements 
could qualify as VASPs under the FATF Standards, (3) provide additional guidance on 
the risks and the tools available to countries to address the ML/TF risks for peer -to-
peer transactions, which are transactions that do not involve any obliged entities, (4) 
provide updated guidance on the licensing and regis tration of VASPs, (5) provide 
additional guidance for the public and private sectors on the  implementation of the

‘travel rule’, and (6) include Principles of Information -Sharing and Co -operation 
Amongst VASP Supervisors. This document incorporates and su persedes the 2019 
Guidance.

PART ONE: 
INTRODUCTION 
Background 
1. New technologies, products, and related services have the potential to spur financial 
innovation and efficiency and improve financial inclusion, but they also create new 
opportunities for criminals and terrorists to launder their proceeds or finance their 
illicit activities. The risk -based approach (RBA) is central to the effective 
implementation of the revised Financial Action Task Force (FATF) International 
Standards on Combating Money Launde ring and the Financing of Terrorism and 
Proliferation, which FATF members adopted in 2012, and the FATF therefore 
actively monitors the risks relating to new technologies. The monitoring of 
emerging risks, including the risks relating to new technologies, should inform the 
risk assessment process of countries and obliged entities and, as per the RBA, 
should guide the allocation of resources as appropriate to mitigate these risks. 
2. In June 2014, the FATF issued Virtual Currencies: Key Definitions and Potentia l 
AML/CFT Risks  in response to the emergence of virtual currencies and their 
associated payment mechanisms for providing new methods of transmitting value 
over the Internet. In June 2015, the FATF issued the Guidance for a Risk -Based 
Approach to Virtual Currencies (the 2015 VC Guidance) as part of a staged approach 
to addressing the money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks 
associated with virtual currency payment products and services. 
3. The 2015 VC Guidance focuses on the points where virtual c urrency activities 
intersect with and provide gateways to and from ( i.e., the on and off ramps to) the 
traditional regulated financial system, in particular convertible virtual currency 
exchangers. In recent years, however, the virtual asset space has evolved to include 
a range of new products and services, business models, and activities and 
interactions, including virtual-to-virtual asset transactions. 
4. In particular, the virtual asset ecosystem has seen the rise of anonymity -enhanced 
cryptocurrencies (AEC s), mixers and tumblers, decentralized platforms and 
exchanges, privacy wallets,2 and other types of products and services that enable or 
allow for reduced transparency and increased obfuscation of financial flows, as well 
as the emergence of other virtual asset business models or activities such as initial 
coin offerings (ICOs) that present ML/TF, fraud and market manipulation risks. 
Further, new illicit financing typologies continue to emerge, including the 
increasing use of virtual -to-virtual layering sc hemes that attempt to further 
obfuscate transactions in a comparatively easy, cheap, and secure manner. 
                                                      
2  Privacy wallets, also called mixing -enabled wallets, allow transfers where multi ple 
people’s transactions are combined into a single transfer.

5. Given the development of additional products and services and the introduction of 
new types of providers in this space, the FATF recognized the need for  further 
clarification on the application of the FATF Standards to new technologies and 
providers. In particular, in October 2018, the FATF adopted two new Glossary 
definitions—“virtual asset” (VA) and “virtual asset service provider” (VASP) —and 
updated Recommendation 15 (R. 15) (see Annex A). The objectives of those changes 
were to further clarify the application of the FATF Standards to VA activities and 
VASPs in order to ensure a level regulatory playing field for VASPs globally and to 
assist jurisdictions in mitigating the ML/TF risks associated with VA activities and 
in protecting the integrity of the global financial system. The FATF also clarified that 
the Standards apply to both virtual -to-virtual and virtual -to-fiat transactions and 
interactions involving VAs. 
6. In June 2019, the FATF adopted an Interpretive Note to Recommendation 15 (INR. 
15) to further clarify how the FATF requirements should apply in relation to VAs 
and VASPs, in particular with regard to the application of the RBA to VA activities or 
operations and VASPs; supervision or monitoring of VASPs for anti -money 
laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) purposes; 
licensing or registration; preventive measures, such as customer due diligence  
(CDD), record -keeping, and su spicious transaction reporting, among others; 
sanctions and other enforcement measures; and international co -operation (see 
Annex A). 
7. The FATF adopted this Guidance at its June 2019 Plenary. Following the adoption of 
this Guidance and the revisions to the FATF Standards, the FATF continued its 
enhanced monitoring of the VA sector and the implementation of the revised 
Standards by countries. In March 2020, the FATF released its Guidance on Digital ID 
to assist in identifying customers in the digital context. While this guidance 
addresses Digital ID broadly, it includes useful information for VASPs. In June 2020, 
the FATF completed its 12-Month Review of the Revised FATF Standards on VAs and 
VASPs, which identified areas where greater FATF guidance was necessary to clarify 
the application of the revised FATF Standards. Simultaneously with this report, the 
FATF also released its Report to the G20 on So-called Stablecoins. This report sets out 
how the revised FATF Standards apply to so -called stablecoins and considers the 
AML/CFT issues.  
8. In September 2020, the FATF also released a report on VA Red Flag Indicators of 
ML/TF for use by the public and private sectors. In March 2021, the FATF released 
its Guidance on a Risk -Based Approach to AML/CFT Supervision . While this report 
addresses AML/CFT supervision broadly, it includes a compendium of information 
for the AML/CFT supervision of VASPs specifically. In July 2021, the FATF released 
its Second 12-Month Review of the Revised FATF Standards on VAs and VASPs . This 
report found that jurisdictions had continued to make progress in implementing the 
revised FATF Standards, but gaps in implementation mean that there is not yet a 
global regime to prevent the misuse of VAs and VASPs for ML/TF. The report also 
includes market metrics relating to peer -to-peer transactions, which are 
transactions that do not involved any obliged entity, and notes that the lack of 
implementation of the travel rule by jurisdictions is acting as disincentive to the 
private sector to invest in travel rule solutions. The report concludes that updated 
Guidance on virtua l assets and VASPs will provide necessary clarity on the 
application of the revised FATF Standards to aid implementation.

9. The 12 -month review report, G20 report and second 12 -month review report 
committed the FATF to release updated Guidance for the public  and private sector 
on the revised FATF Standards and their application to VAs and VASPs. In particular, 
these reports set out six main areas where greater Guidance was sought. To address 
these six areas, this Guidance was updated in November 2021  to (1) c larify the 
definitions of VA and VASP to make clear that these definitions are expansive and 
there should not be a case where a relevant financial asset is not covered by the 
FATF Standards (either as a VA or as another financial asset), (2) provide guidance 
on how the FATF Standards apply to ‘so-called’ stablecoins3 and clarify that a range 
of entities involved in stablecoin arrangements could qualify as VASPs under the 
FATF Standards, (3) provide additional guidance on the risks and the tools available 
to countries to address the ML/TF risks for peer -to-peer transactions (4) provide 
updated guidance on the licensing and registration of VASPs, (5) provide additional 
guidance for the public and private sectors on the implementation of the ‘travel rule’ 
and (6) include Principles of Information-Sharing and Co-operation Amongst VASP 
Supervisors. The Guidance was also updated to reflect the passage of time and the 
publication of the other FATF reports, including those outlined above. The updates 
to this Guidance are summarised in Annex B. 
Purpose of the Guidance 
10. This updated Guidance expands on the 2015 VC Guidance and further explains the 
application of the RBA to AML/CFT measures for VAs; identifies the entities that 
conduct activities or operations relating to  VA—i.e., VASPs; and clarifies the 
application of the FATF Recommendations to VAs and VASPs. The Guidance is 
intended to help national authorities in understanding and developing regulatory 
responses to covered VA activities and VASPs, including by amending national laws, 
where applicable, in their respective jurisdictions in order to address the ML/TF 
risks associated with covered VA activities and VASPs.  
11. The Guidance also is intended to help private sector entities seeking to engage in VA 
activities or operations as defined in the FATF Glossary to better understand their 
AML/CFT obligations and how they can effectively comply with the FATF 
requirements. It provides guidelines to countries, competent authorities, and 
industry for the design and implementat ion of a risk -based AML/CFT regulatory 
and supervisory framework for VA activities and VASPs, including the application 
of preventive measures su ch as customer due diligence , record -keeping, and 
suspicious transaction reporting, among other measures. 
12. The G uidance incorporates the terms adopted by the FATF in October 2018 and 
readers are referred to the FATF Glossary definitions for “virtual asset” and “virtual 
asset service provider” (Annex A).  
13. The Guidance seeks to explain how the FATF Recommendations should apply to VA 
activities and VASPs; provides examples, where relevant or potentially most useful; 
and identifies obstacles to applying mitigating measures alongside potential 
solutions. It is intended to serve as a complement to R. 15 and INR. 15  which 
                                                      
3  Note on terminology: The FATF considers that the term “stablecoin” is not a clear legal or 
technical category, but is primarily a marketing term used by promoters of such coins. 
Because of this, the FATF used the term “so -called stablecoins” in its report to G20. To 
reflect the common usage of the term, this Guidance refers to them as stablecoins, but 
this does not represent endorsement of their claims. 
10  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS

describe the full range of obligations applicable to VASPs as well as to VAs under the 
FATF Recommendations, including the Recommendations relating to “property,” 
“proceeds,” “funds,” “funds or other assets,” and other “corresponding value.” In 
doing so, the Guidance supports the effective implementation of national AML/CFT 
measures for the regulation and supervision of VASPs (as well as other obliged 
entities) and the covered VA activities in which they engage and the development of 
a common understanding of what a RBA to AML/CFT entails. 
14. While the FATF notes that some countries have implemented regulatory regimes 
for VAs and VASPs, many jurisdictions have not yet put in place effective AML/CFT 
frameworks for mitigating the ML/TF risks associated with VA ac tivities in 
particular, even as VA activities develop globally and VASPs increasingly operate 
across jurisdictions. The rapid development, increasing functionality, growing 
adoption, and global, cross-border nature of VAs therefore makes the urgent action 
by countries to mitigate the ML/TF risks presented by VA activities and VASPs a key 
priority of the FATF. The use of virtual assets by ransomware networks is also a 
critical concern, and the growth of ransomware attacks has increased the 
importance of this  effort to introduce effective AML/CFT frameworks globally. 
While this Guidance is intended to facilitate the implementation of the RBA to 
covered VA activities and VASPs for AML/CFT purposes, the FATF recognizes that 
other types of policy considerations, separate from AML/CFT, may come into play 
and shape the regulatory response to the VASP sector in individual jurisdictions.  
Scope of the Guidance 
15. The FATF Recommendations require all jurisdictions to impose specified, activities-
based AML/CFT requirements  on financial institutions (FIs), designated non -
financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) and VASPs and ensure their 
compliance with those obligations. The FATF has agreed that all of the funds - or 
value-based terms in the FATF Recommendations ( e.g., “property,” “proceeds,” 
“funds,” “funds or other assets,” and other “corresponding value”) include VAs and 
that countries should apply all of the relevant measures under the FATF 
Recommendations to VAs, VA activities, and VASPs. The primary focus of the 
Guidance is to describe how the Recommendations apply to VAs, VA activities, and 
VASPs in order to help countries better understand how they should implement the 
FATF Standards effectively. 
16. Further, the Guidance focuses on VAs that are convertible to other f unds or value, 
including both VAs that are convertible to another VA and VAs that are convertible 
to fiat or that intersect with the fiat financial system. It does not address other 
regulatory matters that are potentially relevant to VAs and VASPs ( e.g., consumer 
and investor protection, prudential safety and soundness, tax, anti -fraud or anti -
market manipulation issues, network IT security standards, or financial stability 
concerns).  
17. This Guidance also does not address central bank -issued digital currenci es. For 
FATF’s purposes, these are not VAs  as they are digital r epresentation of fiat 
currencies. The FATF Standards however apply to central bank digital currencies 
similar to any other form of fiat currency issued by a central bank. 4 Central bank 
digital currencies may have unique ML/TF risks compared with physical fiat 
                                                      
4  Further information on central bank digital currencies is in Annex B of the FATF’s Report 
to the G20 on So-called Stablecoins.

currency, depending on their design. Such ML/TF risks should be addressed in a 
forward-looking manner before the launch of any CBDCs. However, their non -
inclusion in this Guidance does not indicate the FATF considers them unimportant. 
Rather, it is a product of the fact that they are categorized as fiat currency, rather 
than the VAs that this Guidance addresses.  
18. The Guidance recognizes that an effective RBA will reflect the nature, diversity, and 
maturity of a country’s VASP sector, the risk profile of the sector, the risk profile of 
individual VASPs operating in the sector and the legal and regulatory approach in 
the country, taking into account the cross-border, Internet-based nature and global 
reach of most VA activities. The Guidance sets out different elements that countries 
and VASPs should consider when designing and implementing a RBA. When 
considering the general principles outlined in the Guidance, national authorities will 
have to  take into consideration their national context, including the supervisory 
approach and legal framework as well as the risks present in their jurisdiction, again 
in light of the potentially global reach of VA activities. 
19. The Guidance takes into account tha t just as illicit actors can abuse any institution 
that engages in financial activities, illicit actors can abuse VASPs engaging in VA 
activities, for ML, TF, sanctions evasion, fraud, ransomware payments and other 
nefarious purposes. The 2015 VC Guidance,  the 2018 FATF Risk, Trends, and 
Methods Group papers relating to this topic, and FATF reports and statements 
relating to the ML/TF risks associated with VAs, VA activities, and/or VASPs, 5 for 
example, highlight and provide further context regarding the ML /TF risks 
associated with VA activities. While VAs may provide another form of value for 
conducting ML and TF, and VA activities may serve as another mechanism for the 
illegal transfer of value or funds, countries should not necessarily categorize VASPs 
or VA activities as inherently high ML/TF risk. The cross-border nature of, potential 
enhanced-anonymity associated with, non -face-to-face business relationships and 
transactions facilitated by and opportunities for disintermediated activity with no 
obliged entity involved in VA activities should nevertheless inform a country’s 
assessment of risk. The extent and quality of a country’s regulatory and supervisory 
framework as well as the implementation of risk -based controls and mitigating 
measures by VASPs als o influence the overall risks and threats associated with 
covered VA activities. The Guidance also recognizes that despite these measures, 
there may still be some residual risk, which competent authorities and VASPs 
should consider in devising appropriate solutions. Jurisdictions should individually 
examine VAs and VASP activities in the context of their own financial sectors and 
regulatory and supervisory systems to arrive at an assessment of their risk. 
20. Since the FATF finalised the revision to its Standards in June 2019, it has continued 
to monitor trends in the use of VAs for ML/TF purposes. As set out in its September 
2020 report on Virtual Asset Red Flag Indicators of ML/TF , the FATF has observed 
                                                      
5  See, for example, the July 2018 FATF report to G -20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank 
Governors; the February 2019 FATF public statement on mitigating risks from virtual 
assets; the April 2019 FATF report to G -20 Finance Ministers a nd Central Bank 
Governors, the October 2019 FATF Statement on money laundering risks from 
“stablecoins” and other emerging assets , the June 2020 12 -month review of the revised 
FATF Standards on virtual assets/VASPs , the June 2020 FATF report to the G20 Finance 
Ministers and Central Bank Governors on so -called stablecoins , the September 2020 
FATF report on virtual assets red flag indicators of ML/TF  and the July 2021 second 12-
month review of the revised FATF Standards on virtual assets/VASPs .

that VAs are becoming increasingly mainstream for criminal activity more broadly. 
The majority of VA-related offences highlighted in the report focused on predicate 
or ML offences, but, criminals also made use of VAs to evade financial sanctions and 
to raise funds to support terrorism. The types of offences reported by jurisdictions 
include ML, the sale of controlled substances and other illegal items (including 
firearms), fraud, tax evasion, computer crimes (e.g. cyberattacks resulting in thefts 
and ransomware), child exploitation, human trafficking, sanctions evasion, and TF. 
Among these, two types of misuse stood out as the most common. These are illicit 
trafficking in controlled substances, eith er with sales transacted directly in VAs or 
the use of VAs as an ML layering technique, and frauds, scams, ransomware attacks, 
and extortion. More recently, the FATF has observed that professional ML networks 
are exploiting VAs as one of their means to transfer, collect, or layer proceeds.  
21. The FATF’s Second 12-Month Review of the Revised FATF Standards on VAs and VASPs 
noted there has been a large increase in the use of VAs to collect ransomware 
payments and to commit and launder the proceeds of fraud, and the pace, 
sophistication, and costs of ransomware attacks was likely to grow. VAs are a vital 
tool for ransomware actors, without which their underlying crime would be much 
harder to monetize. This makes effective and consistent implementation of the 
FATF Standards in this area all the more crucial. The report also highlights 
jurisdictional arbitrage and the associated problem of non -compliant or weakly 
compliant VASPs and tools and methods to increase anonymity as t he main trends 
in the VA ML/TF risk landscape. Illicit actors are taking advantage of poor CDD and 
screening processes within these VASPs for ML/T F purposes, which underscores 
the importance of effective, on-the-ground implementation of the FATF Standards. 
Tools and methods to increase anonymity in virtual asset transfers also continued 
to be used and developed.  The report also highlights challenges  such as 
decentralization and the definitions of VA and VASP, peer-to-peer transactions and 
implementation, including of the travel rule.  
22. The Guidance recognizes that “new” or innovative technologies or mechanisms for 
engaging in, or that facilitate finan cial activity may not automatically constitute 
“better” approaches and that jurisdictions should also assess the risks arising from 
and appropriately mitigate the risks  of such new methods of performing a 
traditional or already -regulated financial activity , such as the use of VAs in the 
context of payment services or securities activities, as well. 
23. Other stakeholders, including VASPs, FIs and other obliged entities that provide 
banking or other financial services to VASPs or to persons involved in VA activities 
themselves should also consider the aforementioned factors. As with all customers, 
FIs should apply a RBA when considering establishing or continuing relationships 
with VASPs or customers involved in VA activities, evaluate the ML/TF risks of the 
business relationship, and assess whether those risks can be appropriately 
mitigated and managed (see Section IV). It is important that FIs apply the RBA 
properly and do not resort to the wholesale termination or exclusion of business 
relationships within the VASP sector without an appropriately -targeted risk 
assessment.  
24. In implementing AML/CFT regimes for VASPs, the FATF and jurisdictions should be 
aware of the intersection and potential impact AML/CFT requirements have on 
other regulatory requirements and po licy areas, such as data protection and 
privacy, financial inclusion, derisking, consumer and investor protection and 
financial innovation.

25. In considering the Guidance, countries, VASPs and other obliged entities that engage 
in or provide covered VA activ ities should recall the key principles underlying the 
design and application of the FATF Recommendations and that are relevant in the 
VA context: 
a. Functional equivalence and objectives -based approach . The FATF 
requirements, including as they apply in the VA  space, are compatible with a 
variety of different legal and administrative systems. They broadly explain 
what must be done but not in an overly -specific manner about how 
implementation should occur in order to allow for different options, where 
appropriate. Any clarifications to the requirements should not require 
jurisdictions that have already adopted adequate measures to achieve the 
objectives of the FATF Recommendations to  change the form or substance of 
their laws and regulations. The Guidance seeks t o support ends -based or 
objectives-based implementation of the relevant FATF Recommendations  
rather than impose a rigid prescriptive one -size-fits-all regulatory regime 
across all jurisdictions. 
b. Technology-neutrality and future -proofing. The requirements a pplicable to 
VAs, as value or funds, to covered VA activities, and to VASPs apply 
irrespective of the technological platform involved. Equally, the requirements 
do not give preference to specific products, services, or solutions offered by 
commercial providers, including technological implementation solutions that 
aim to assist providers in complying with their AML/CFT obligations. Rather, 
the requirements are intended to have sufficient flexibility so that countries 
and relevant entities can apply them to existing technologies as well as to 
evolving and emerging technologies without requiring additional revisions.  
c. Level-playing field (functional treatment) . Countries and their competent 
authorities should treat all varieties of VASPs, regardless of busines s model, 
on an equal footing from a regulatory and supervisory perspective when they 
provide fundamentally similar services and pose similar risks. Where their 
risk profiles differ, however, the treatment may differ in -line with the RBA. 
Similarly, countries should aim to keep regulation and supervision for VASPs 
consistent with what exists for FIs that provide the same services and carry 
similar ML/TF risks . It is an assessment of risks, based on the nature of the 
products and services offered, that should  guide countries in imposing 
regulation and supervision, and not terminology, technology or business 
model. Moreover, all countries should strive to ensure their domestic regimes 
contribute to even and efficient implementation globally in order to avoid 
jurisdictional and supervisory arbitrage, although there is no impediment to 
countries imposing additional requirements that go beyond the FATF 
Standards to respond to their own risks or policies.  
26. This Guidance is non-binding and clarifies and interprets the existing Standards, but 
does not change them. The Guidance  does not overrule the purview of national 
authorities, including on their assessment and categorization of VASPs, VAs, and VA 
activities, as per the prevailing ML/TF risks, and other contextual f actors. It draws 
on the experiences of countries and of the private sector and is intended to assist 
competent authorities, VASPs, and relevant FIs (e.g., banks engaging in covered VA 
activities) in effectively implementing the FATF Recommendations using a RBA.

Structure 
27. This Guidance is organized as follows: Section II examines how VA activities and 
VASPs fall within the scope of the FATF Recommendations; Section III describes the 
application of the FATF Recommendations to countries and competent authorities; 
Section IV explains the application of the FATF Recommendations to VASPs and 
other obliged entities that engage in or provide VA covered activities, including FIs 
such as banks and securities broker -dealers, among others; Section V provides 
examples o f jurisdictional approaches to regulating, supervising, and enforcing 
covered VA activities and VASPs (and other obliged entities) for AML/CFT; and 
Section VI sets out Principles for International Co -operation and Information -
Sharing amongst VASP Supervisors. 
28. Annex A sets out the updated text of Recommendation 15 and its Interpretive Note, 
and the “virtual asset” and “virtual asset service provider” definitions within the 
FATF Glossary. Annex B sets out the changes made to this Guidance in the November 
2021 update.

PART TWO: 
SCOPE OF FATF STANDARDS 
29. Section II discusses the applicability of the RBA to VA activities and VASPs and 
explains how these activities and providers should be subject to AML/CFT 
requirements under the international standards. As descr ibed in paragraph 2 of 
INR. 15, VASPs are subject to the relevant measures under the FATF 
Recommendations based on the types of activities in which they engage. Similarly, 
VAs are captured by the relevant measures under the FATF Recommendations that 
relate to funds or value, broadly, or that specifically reference funds- or value-based 
terms. 
30. It should be underscored that when VASPs engage in traditional fiat-only activities 
or fiat-to-fiat transactions (which are outside the scope of the virtual-to-virtual and 
virtual-to-fiat activities covered by the VASP definition), they are subject to the 
same measures as any other equivalent traditional institution or entity normally 
would be under the FATF standards. 
Initial Risk Assessment 
31. The FATF Recommendations do  not prejudge any sector as higher risk. The 
standards identify secto rs that may be vulnerable to ML/ TF; however the overall 
risk at a national level should be determined by individual jurisdictions through an 
assessment of the sector —in this case, the VAS P sector. Different entities within a 
sector may pose a higher or lower risk depending on a variety of factors, including 
products, services, customers, geography, business models and the strength of the 
entity’s compliance program. Recommendation 1 sets o ut the scope of the 
application of the RBA as follows: who should be subject to a country’s regime; how 
those subject to the AML/CFT regime should be supervised or monitored for 
compliance with the regime; how those subject to the AML/CFT regime should be 
required to comply; and consideration of the engagement in business relationships 
by VASPs and other obliged entities involved in covered VA activities. Further, the 
FATF does not support the wholesale and indiscriminate termination or restriction 
of business relationships with a particular sector (e.g., FIs terminating relationships 
with all VASPs regardless of the different risk profile among them) to avoid, rather 
than manage, risk in line with the FATF’s RBA. 
32. Under the RBA and in accordance with paragra ph 2 of INR. 15, countries should 
identify, assess, and understand the ML/TF risks emerging from this space and 
ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate ML/TF are commensurate with the 
risks identified. Similarly, countries should require VASPs (as well as other obliged 
entities that engage in VA financial activities or operations or provide VA products 
or services) to identify, assess, and take effective action to mitigate their ML/TF 
risks. 
16  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
33. A VASP’s risk assessment should take into account all of the r isk factors that the 
VASP as well as its competent authorities consider relevant, including the types of 
services, products, or transactions involved; customer risk; geographical factors; 
type(s) of VA exchanged, among other factors.  
34. VAs can enable non -face-to-face business relationships or permit transactions to 
take place without the use  or involvement of a VASP or a FI. Further, VAs can be 
used to quickly move funds globally, nearly instantaneously and largely irreversibly, 
and to facilitate a range of financial activities —from money or value transfer 
services to securities, commodities or derivatives -related activity, among others. 
These factors in VA financial activities or operations may indicate higher ML/TF 
risks, and thus may require appropriate ri sk mitigating measures to identify or 
combat relevant illicit activities such as the use of strong digital identity solutions.6 
Similarly, VA products or services that facilitate pseudonymous or anonymity -
enhanced transactions also pose higher ML/TF risks,  particularly if they inhibit a 
VASP’s ability to identify the beneficiary. Lack of customer and counterparty 
identification is especially concerning in the context of VAs, which are cross-border 
in nature. If customer identification and verification measu res do not adequately 
address the risks associated with non -face-to-face or opaque transactions, the 
ML/TF risks increase, as does the difficulty in tracing the associated funds and 
identifying transaction counterparties.  
35. The extent to which users can use  VAs or VASPs globally for making payments or 
transferring funds is also an important factor that countries should take into 
account when determining the level of risk. Illicit users of VAs, for example, may 
take advantage of the global reach and transacti on speed that VAs provide, as well 
as inadequate or uneven regulation or supervision of VA financial activities and 
providers across jurisdictions, which creates an inconsistent legal and regulatory 
playing field in the VA ecosystem. As with other mobile or Internet-based payment 
services and mechanisms that can be used to transfer funds globally or in a wide 
geographical area with a large number of counterparties, VAs can be more attractive 
to criminals for ML/TF purposes than purely domestic business models.  
36. In addition, VASPs located in one jurisdiction may offer their products and services 
to customers located in another jurisdiction where they may be subject to different 
AML/CFT obligations and oversight. This is of concern where the VASP is located in 
a jurisdiction with weak or even non-existent AML/CFT controls, or where there is 
a shortfall in the ability of jurisdictions to provide the widest range of international 
co-operation. Similarly, the sheer range of providers in the VA space and their 
presence across several, if not nearly all, jurisdictions can increase the ML/TF risks 
associated with VAs and VA financial activities due to potential gaps in customer 
and transaction information. This is a particular concern in the context of cross -
border transactions and when there is a lack of clarity on which entities or persons 
(natural or legal) involved in the transaction are subject to AML/CFT measures and 
which countries are responsible for regulating (including licensing and/or 
registering) and supervising or monitoring those entities for compliance with their 
AML/CFT obligations.

Box 1. Stablecoins and ML/TF risks 
Stablecoins purport to maintain a stable value relative to some reference 
asset or assets. As noted in the FATF’s report to G20, they share many of 
the same ML/TF risks as some VAs, because of their potential for 
anonymity, global reach and use to layer illicit funds. However, certain 
stablecoin projects could have greater potential for mass -adoption, 
which could heighten ML/TF risks. As such, while the potential for mass-
adoption is a factor relevant to all VAs, it is a particularly relevant factor 
to consider in assessing the ML/TF risks of stablecoins.  
Mass-adoption is an important ML/TF risk factor to consider, because 
criminals’ ability to use a VA as a means of exchange depends to a great 
extent on it being freely exchangeable and  liquid, which mass-adoption 
could facilitate. Additionally, if a VA achieves sufficient global adoption 
such that it is used as a medium of exchange and store of value without 
the use of a VASP or other obliged entities, the lack of or insufficient 
AML/CFT controls and compliance could heighten ML/TF risks. 7 
Stablecoins can have characteristics which could overcome factors 
which have held back the widespread adoption of VAs as a means of 
payment. By maintaining a stable value, stablecoins are designed to 
overcome the price volatility issues often associated with many VAs. 
Reduction of volatility could encourage their widespread use as a means 
of payment or transferring funds, particularly where they are sponsored 
by large technology, telecommunications or financial firms that could 
offer global payment arrangements.  
Like VAs more broadly, the features of a stablecoin will also impact the 
extent to which ML/TF risks materialise. Stablecoins can be more 
centralised or more decentralised, both in terms of their governance and 
in terms of who can access the stablecoin (e.g., whether it allows 
unhosted wallets or not, whether the system is permissioned or 
permissionless) and offer related services. These design choices can 
have implications for ML/TF risks and the design may change over time 
as the stablecoin arrangement evolves. For example, central governance 
bodies of stablecoins will, in general, be covered by the FATF standards 
either as a VASP or a FI. When a similar function is provided with a 
degree of de centralisation, it is expected that countries will take a 
functional approach to identify obliged entities and will mitigate the 
relevant risk s based on a RBA regardless of institutional design and 
names.8

Arrangements: Final Report and High-Level Recommendations.

In-line with their general obligations under the FATF Standards relating 
to new technologies9, countries, VASPs and other obliged entities should 
identify and assess ML/TF risks relating to stablecoins before launch 
and in an ongoing and forward -looking manner, and take appropriate 
measures to manage and  mitigate the risks before launch. These risks 
should continue to be mitigated, even after their launch, and take into 
account the evolving risk if the stablecoin(s) become mass-adopted. 
Peer-to-peer transactions 
37. The FATF defines p eer-to-peer’ (P2P) trans actions as VA transfers conducted 
without the use or involvement of a VASP or other obliged entity (e.g., VA transfers 
between two unhosted wallets  whose users are acting on their own behalf ).10 P2P 
transactions are not explicitly subject to AML/CFT control s under the FATF 
Standards. This is because the Standards generally place obligations on 
intermediaries, rather than on individuals themselves (with some exceptions, such 
as requirements related to implementing targeted financial sanctions).  
38. The FATF recognises that P2P transactions could pose specific ML/TF risks, as they 
can potentially be used to avoid AML/CFT controls in the FATF Standards. Where 
VA transfers occur on a P2P basis, there  are no obliged entities involved in 
preventing or mitigating ML/TF risks. While P2P transactions are also used for licit 
activity, illicit actors can exploit the lack of obliged intermediary in P2P transactions 
to obscure the proceeds of crime because there is no obliged entity carrying out the 
core functions of the FATF Standards, such as CDD and filing suspicious transaction 
reports (STR). Conversely, visibility of P2P transactions on public ledgers  might 
support financial analysis and  law enforcement  investigations, especially when 
combined with other information sourc es, unless there are anonymity -enhancing 
protocols and technologies associated with the VA.  
39. The FATF's Second 12-Month Review report provides an overview of the extent to 
which VAs are used on a P2P basis , based on data provided by seven blockchain 
analytic companies.11 This report indicated that a potentially significant amount of 
certain VAs is transferred on a P2P basis, and the share of identified illicit 
transactions appears higher for P2P transactions compared with direct transactions 
with VASPs. Howe ver, the high level of variation in the data provided by the 
blockchain analytic companies means that there is no consensus on the size of the 
P2P sector and its associated ML/TF risk. It also reveals the challenges and 
limitations inherent in this kind of  research with blockchain analytics, in terms of 
coverage, timeliness, accuracy and reliability, even if P2P transactions are recorded 
on public ledgers.  
40. As such, these results underscore the need for countries to understand the ML/TF 
risks related to P2P transactions and how P2P transactions are being used in their 
                                                      
9  See Recommendation 15 in Section III below for further information on VASP’s 
obligations regarding new technologies. 
10  Some VASPs may market themselves as P2P platforms. These are separate from P2P 
transactions noted here and are addressed in paragraph 93. Additionally,  natural persons 
can be a VASP (see paragraph 58). If such a VASP is involved in a transaction, it is not a P2P 
transaction. 
11  See paragraphs 76-102 of the FATF’s Second 12 Month Review Report.  
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  19 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
jurisdiction on a dynamic basis, particularly when new types of VA enter the market 
or pre -existing VAs reach mass -adoption. While the FATF has not observed a 
distinct trend towards increased usage of P2P transactions so far, there remains the 
potential risk that more VA transactions will move to P2P space to avoid 
regulations/supervision as more jurisdictions implement the FATF Standards and 
regulate and supervise VASPs. If P2P transactions were to increase to the point that 
illicit activity was occurring to a significant degree in the VA ecosystem on a P2P 
basis, without interacting with VASPs or other on- and off-ramps to the traditional 
fiat economy, this could potentially challenge the effectiveness of implementing the 
FATF Standards. Therefore, ML/TF risks related to P2P transactions should be 
monitored in an ongoing and forward-looking manner. If countries determine P2P 
transactions to present higher ML/TF risks necessitating additional mit igations, 
they can consider the non -exhaustive list of optional measures in paragraph 105 -
106 of this Guidance, on the basis of the assessed risk. 
41. As part of this, countries and VASPs should seek to understand what types of P2P 
transactions pose higher or lower risk and understand drivers of P2P transactions 
and their different risk profiles. Relevant factors that could, depending on the design 
of the VA, potentially impact the extent to which users engage in P2P transactions 
include the VA’s accessibility  and protocols that control the VA’s  privacy, 
transparency, security and associated transaction fees.. Jurisdictions need to weigh 
these various factors and assess how they manifest themselves in each country to 
assess risk and apply mitigating controls consistent with a RBA. The rapid evolution 
of this sector means that changes in the level and nature of the risk are likely to 
come quickly and to merit concerted supervisory attention. 
Risk factors relating to VAs and VASPs  
42. There exist ML/TF risks in relation to VAs, VA financial activities or operations, and 
VASPs. In addition to consulting the previous FATF works on this subject 12 and the 
FATF’s general guidance on risk assessments, 13 countries and VASPs should 
consider the following non -exhaustive list of e lements, for example, when 
identifying, assessing, and determining how best to mitigate the risks associated 
with covered VA activities and the provision of VASP products or services: 
Elements relating to VAs  
a. The number and the value of VA transfers; the value and price volatility of the 
VA issued; the market capitalisation of the VA; the value in circulation; the 
number of jurisdictions of users and the number of users in each jurisdiction; 
the market share in payments for a VA in each jurisdiction;  and the extent to 
which the VA is used for cross-border payments and remittances; 
b. The potential ML/TF risks associated with VAs that are exchanged with/for 
fiat currency or for other VAs  and the extent to which VA -based transaction 
                                                      
12  For example, the 2015 VC Guidance, 2018 FATF Risk, Trends, and Methods Group papers 
relating to this topic, and FATF statements and reports relating to the ML/TF risks 
associated with VAs, VA activities, and/or VASPs. Further information on VAs i s also 
available in the FATF’s 2020 Virtual Assets Red Flag Indicators of Money Laundering and 
Terrorist Financing.  
13  For example, the 2013 National ML/TF Risk Assessment Guidance  and the 2019 TF Risk 
Assessment Guidance.

channels/platforms interact w ith, or are connected to fiat -based transaction 
channels/platforms and digital services/platforms; 
c. The nature and scope of the VA payment channel or system (e.g., open- versus 
closed-loop systems or systems intended to facilitate micro -payments or 
government-to-person/person-to-government payments);  
d. The number and value of VA transfers and those relating to illicit activities 
(e.g., darknet marketplaces, ransomware and hacking) in the following 
categories; (1) between VASPs/other obliged entities, (2) betw een 
VASPs/other obliged entities and non -obliged entities, and (3) between non -
obliged entities (i.e. P2P transactions); 
e. The use of anonymizing techniques for VA funds transfers ( e.g., AECs, mixing 
and tumbling services, the clustering of wallet addresses, privacy wallets) and 
de-anonymizing techniques ( e.g., and risk assessment of wallet addresses 
using blockchain analytical tools); 
f. Exposure to Internet Protocol (IP) anonymizers such as The Onion Router 
(Tor), the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) and other  anonymizing software or 
anonymity enhancements, which may further obfuscate transactions or 
activities and inhibit a VASP’s ability to know its users and implement effective 
AML/CFT measures; and 
g. The size of the business, the existing customer-base, the stakeholders, and the 
significance of the cross -border activities of the issuer and/or the central 
entity governing the arrangement (where this exists). 
Elements relating to VASPs  
a. The number and types of VASPs that are based in a jurisdiction and/or 
offerings services to persons based in a jurisdiction and the number and 
amount of transactions relating to each service; 
b. The sophistication of the VASP’s AML/CFT program, including the existence 
or absence of appropriate oversight tools to monitor VA and/or VAS P 
activities, including whether there is appropriate knowledge and expertise of 
the individuals responsible for compliance with the AML/CFT program related 
to the VA; 
c. The size and type of the user base of the VASP, including the VASP’s access to 
data on it s users and their activity, both within the VASP and if there is 
potential aggregation across platforms; 
d. The nature and scope of the VA account, product or service ( e.g., small value 
savings and storage accounts that primarily enable financially -excluded 
persons to store limited value) that the VASP offers;  
e. Any parameters or measures in place that may potentially lower the 
provider’s (whether a VASP or other obliged entity that engages in VA 
activities or provides VA products and services) exposure to risk  (e.g., 
limitations on transactions or account balance);  
f. Whether the VASP operates entirely online ( e.g., platform-based exchanges) 
or in person ( e.g., trading platforms that facilitate transactions between 
individual users or kiosk-based exchanges); 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  21 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
g. The potential ML/TF and sanctions risks associated with a VASP’s connections 
and links to jurisdictions; 
h. Whether the VASP implements the ‘travel rule’ or not and how effectively it 
has mitigated the ‘sunrise issue’ (see Recommendation 16 in Sections III and 
IV); 
i. Transactions from / to non -obliged entities ( e.g., unhosted wallets with no 
obliged entity, VASPs in jurisdictions where they are not subject to regulation 
and supervision, etc.) and transactions where at an earlier stage P2P 
transactions have occurred provided that such data collection is in line with 
national privacy legislation; 
j. The specific types of VAs that the VASP offers or plans to offer and any unique 
features of each VA, such as AECs, embedded mixers or tumblers, or other 
products and services that may present higher risks by potentially obfuscating 
the transactions or undermining a VASP’s ability to know its customers and 
implement effective CDD and other AML/CFT measures; and 
k. VASPs’ interaction with, or management of, any smart contracts14 that may be 
used to conduct transactions. 
Prohibition or limitation of VAs/VASPs 
43. Some countries may decide to prohibit or limit VA activities or VASPs, and those VA 
activities carried out by non-obliged entities, based on their assessment of risk and 
national regulatory context or in order to support other policy goals not addressed 
in this Guidance ( e.g., consumer or investor protection, market protection, safety 
and soundness, or monetary policy). In such cases, some of the specific 
requirements of R. 15 would not apply, but jurisdictions would still need to assess 
the risks associated with covered VA activities or providers and have tools and 
authorities in place to take action for non -compliance with  the prohibition or 
limitation. In deciding whether to prohibit or limit VA activities of VASPs, countries 
should understand the ML/TF risks associated with VAs. A country should ensure 
that it has the technical capacity and resources to enforce such a prohibition or 
limitation.  
FATF Definitions and Features of the VASP Sector Relevant for AML/CFT 
44. The FATF Recommendations require all jurisdictions to impose specified AML/CFT 
requirements on FIs, DNFBPs and VASPs and ensure their compliance with those 
obligations. In the Glossary, the FATF defines: 
a. “Financial insti tution” as any natural or legal person who conducts as a 
business one or more of several specified activities or operations for or on 
behalf of a customer; 
b. “Virtual asset” as a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded 
or transferred and  can be used for payment or investment purposes. Virtual 
assets do not include digital representations of fiat currencies, securities, and 
                                                      
14  In a VA context, a smart contract is a computer program or a protocol that is designed to 
automatically execute specific actions such as VA transfer between participants without 
the direct involvement of a third party when certain conditions are met.

other financial assets that are already covered elsewhere in the FATF 
Recommendations; and 
c. “Virtual asset service pro vider” as any natural or legal person who is not 
covered elsewhere under the Recommendations and as a business conducts 
one or more of the following activities or operations for or on behalf of another 
natural or legal person: 
i. Exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies; 
ii. Exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets; 
iii. Transfer15 of virtual assets; and 
iv. Safekeeping and/or administration of virtual assets or instruments 
enabling control over virtual assets;  
v. Participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer’s 
offer and/or sale of a virtual asset.  
Background and general considerations for the definition of VA and VASP 
45. The purpose of adding the new definitions of VA and VASP to the FATF Glossary was 
to broaden the applicabili ty of the FATF Standards to encompass new types of 
digital assets and providers of certain services in those assets. It was not intended 
to subtract from the existing definitions of “funds”, “funds or other assets”, or from 
the scope of the various financi al services included under the definition of a 
“financial institution” in the FATF Standards.  
46. Financial assets should not be deemed uncovered by the FATF Recommendations 
because of the format in which they are offered and no financial asset should be 
interpreted as falling entirely outside the FATF Standards. For example, if a country 
determines that a digital asset falls out of the definition of a VA but is a financial 
asset, that asset is still covered by the FATF Recommendations as the relevant  
financial asset. Therefore, the provider of relevant services with that asset may be 
deemed as a FI. Each country must determine whether such assets and their activity 
fall into the definition of VA or  some other variety of  financial asset and VASPs or 
FIs. Regardless, the FATF Recommendations apply similarly with only minor 
accommodations.16  
What is a virtual asset? 
47. The definition of VA is meant to be interpreted broadly, with jurisdictions relying 
on the fundamental concepts contained in it to take a functional a pproach that can 
accommodate technological advancements and innovative business models. In line 
with the overall ethos of the FATF Recommendations, these definitions aim for 
technology neutrality. That is, they should be applied based on the basic 
characteristics of the asset or the service, not the technology it employs. There are 
therefore a few key elements to elaborate.  
                                                      
15  In this context of virtual assets, transfer means to conduct a transaction on behalf of 
another natural or legal person that moves a virtual asset from one virtual asset address 
or account to another. 
16 These are in  relation to CDD (Recommendation 10) and wire transfer rules 
(Recommendation 16) (i.e. the travel rule). See Sections III and IV below for further 
explanation of these obligations.

48. Firstly, VAs must be digital and must themselves be digitally traded or transferred 
and be capable of being used for payment or invest ment purposes. In choosing the 
terms “traded” and “transferred” the FATF intentionally created a broad, general 
definition of VA, which covers a wide range of activities. This could include, for 
example, the issuance of an asset to another person , exchanging it for something 
else, transferring it to someone else  or on behalf of someone else , changing its 
ownership, or destroying it.   
49. VAs cannot be merely digital representations of fiat currencies, securities and other 
financial assets that are already covered elsewhere in the FATF Recommendations, 
without an inherent ability themselves to be digitally traded or transferred and the 
possibility to be used for payment or investment purposes.  
50. For this reason, a bank record maintained in digital format, for ins tance, which 
represents a person’s ownership of fiat currency is not a VA. If it functions as a mere 
declarative record of ownership or positions in a financial asset that is already 
covered by the FATF Standards, it is not a VA. However, a digital asset t hat is 
exchangeable for another asset, such as a stablecoin that is exchangeable for a fiat 
currency or a VA at a stable rate, could still qualify as a VA. The key question in this 
context is whether the VA has inherent value to be traded or transferred an d used 
for payment or investment or, rather, is simply a means of recording or representing 
ownership of something else. It bears repeating, however, that assets that do not 
qualify as VAs should not be presumed to fall outside the scope of the FATF 
Standards. Instead, they may fall under other kinds of financial assets, such as 
securities, commodities, derivatives or fiat currency.  
51. The FATF does not intend for an asset to be both a VA and a financial asset at the 
same time. There may however be instances where the same asset will be classified 
differently under different national frameworks or the same asset might be 
regulated under multiple different categorizations. When determining if a new 
digital asset should qualify as a financial asset or a VA, auth orities should consider 
whether their existing regime governing financial assets or their regime for VAs can 
be appropriately applied to the new digital assets in question. For example, if the 
asset in question is the functional digital equivalent of cash,  a bearer negotiable 
instrument or bearer share, authorities should consider how the mitigation 
measures in the relevant regime would apply to it.  
52. In instances where characterization proves difficult, jurisdictions should assess 
their regulatory systems a nd decide which designation will best mitigat e and 
manage the risk of the product  or service. Jurisdictions should also consider the 
commonly accepted usage of the asset ( e.g., whether it is used for payment or 
investment purposes) and what type of regulatory regime offers the best fit. Should 
a jurisdiction choose to define an asset as a financial asset as opposed to a VA, 
existing AML/CFT standards and the guidance that accompanies financial assets 
would apply. Consistent with the technology-neutral approach, a blockchain-based 
asset that is defined as a financial asset would likely not fall under this VA -focused 
Guidance. This is because the technology used is not the deciding factor in 
determining which FATF Recommendations apply. Elements of this Guidance may, 
however, still prove helpful to jurisdictions and the private sector and should 
supplement other existing guidance in the context of the RBA. Nonetheless, every 
asset for payment or investment should be subject to obligations applicable either 
as a VA or another type of financial asset.

53. Digital assets that are unique, rather than interchangeable, and that are in practice 
used as collectibles  rather than as payment or investment instruments, can be 
referred to as a non -fungible tokens (NFT) or crypto -collectibles. Such assets, 
depending on their characteristics, are generally not considered to be VAs under the 
FATF definition. However, it is important to consider the nature of the NFT and its 
function in practice and not what terminology or marketing terms are used. This is 
because the FATF Standards may cover them, regardless of the terminology.  Some 
NFTs that on their face do not appear to constitute VAs may fall under the VA 
definition if they are to be used for payment or investment purposes  in practice. 
Other NFTs are digital representations of other financial assets already covered by 
the FATF Standards. Such assets are therefore excluded from the FATF definition of 
VA, but would be covered by the FATF Standards as that type of financial asset. 17 
Given that the VA space is rapidly evolving, the functional approach is particularly 
relevant in the context of NFTs and other similar digital assets . Countries should 
therefore consider the application of the FATF Standards to NFTs on a case -by-case 
basis. 
54. The FATF reaffirms statements in its G20 report that a stablecoin is covered by the 
Standards as either a VA or a financial asset (e.g., a security) according to the same 
criteria used for any other kind of digital asset, depending on its exact nature and  
the regulatory regime in a country.  
What is a VASP? 
55. As stated in the FATF Glossary, a “virtual asset service provider” is any natural or 
legal person  who is not covered elsewhere under the Recommendations  and as a  
business conducts one or more of the fol lowing activities or operations for or on 
behalf of another natural or legal person: 
i. Exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies; 
ii. Exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets; 
iii. Transfer18 of virtual assets;  
iv. Safekeeping and/or administration  of virtual assets or instruments 
enabling control over virtual assets; and 
v. Participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer’s 
offer and/or sale of a virtual asset.  
56. As with the definition of VA, the definition of VASP should be rea d broadly. 
Countries should take a functional approach and apply the following concepts 
underlying the definition to determine whether an entity is undertaking the 
functions of a VASP. Countries should not apply their definition based on the 
nomenclature o r terminology which the entity adopts to describe itself or the 
technology it employs for its activities. As set out above, the definitions do not 
depend on the technology employed by the service provider. The obligations in the 
FATF Standards stem from the underlying financial services offered without regard 
to an entity’s operational model, technological tools, ledger design, or any other 
                                                      
17  See paragraph 50.  
18  In this context of virtual assets, transfer means  to conduct a transaction on behalf of 
another natural or legal person that moves a virtual asset from  one virtual asset address 
or account to another. 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  25 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
operating feature. To assist in illustrating the concepts of the definition, the section 
below includes examples which  use general terms to describe common business 
models. However, these should not obscure the fact that the definition is meant to 
be applied based on an assessment of whether the entity in question provides a 
qualifying service, not these terms themselves.  
57. Before looking at individual functions, there are a few common elements that must 
be understood. As discussed in the VA definition, to avoid repetition or overlap, the 
definition of VASP only applies to entities “ not covered elsewhere under the 
Recommendations”. It excludes FIs or DNFBPs covered elsewhere in the FATF 
Standards. Jurisdictions have to apply the definition that is the most appropriate, 
based on an understanding of the conceptual foundations of each definition. The 
primary difference between VASPs and traditional FIs from the standpoint of this 
Guidance is the application of Recommendations 10 and 16, so jurisdictions may 
wish to apply the definition that provides more thorough regulatory and 
supervisory coverage.19  
58. The first use of the word “person” in the definition refers to the person that conducts 
the relevant activity or operation listed in limbs (i)-(v) of the definition. The person 
can be either a legal person, such as a company, or a natural (individual) person.  
59. “Conducts” includes the provision and/or active facilitation of a service, which refers 
to active involvement in the provision of activities covered under limbs (i)-(v) of the 
VASP definition. It is meant to exclude ancillary participants that do not provide or 
actively facilit ate any of these covered activities , such as entities which provide 
Internet or cloud services. 
60. The phrase “as a business” is meant to exclude those who may carry out a function 
on a very infrequent basis for non-commercial reasons from coverage as VASPs. To 
satisfy this portion of a definition, the entity must carry out this function for or on 
behalf of another natural or legal person as opposed to on behalf of itself, for 
commercial reasons, and must do so on at least a sufficiently regular basis, rather 
than infrequently.  
61. The phrase “for or on behalf of another natural or legal person” includes carrying out 
of the function in the course of providing a covered service to another person. This 
person for whom or on whose behalf financial services may be conducted may also 
be referred to as a “user” or “customer” of those services. This means, for example, 
that an internal transfer of VAs by a single legal person within that legal person (that 
is, within units of a particular company for example)  would not qualify as a VASP, 
unless that transfer was for or on behalf of a nother person in the context of 
providing VASP services. 
62. A person who meets these requirements will then be a VASP if it carries out one or 
more of the five categories of activity or operation described in the VASP definition 
(i.e., “exchange” of virtual/fiat, “exchange” of virtual/virtual, “transfer,” 
“safekeeping and/or administration,” and “participation in and provision of 
financial services related to an issuer’s offer and/or sale”). The co verage of each 
limb of the definition is set out below. 
                                                      
19  These differences are in relation to CDD (Recommendation 10), to lower the CDD 
occasional transaction  threshold, and wire transfer rules (Recommendation 16) which 
apply in an amended way to VA transfers (i.e. the travel rule). See Sections III and IV below 
for further explanation of these obligations.  
26  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
Exchange and transfer  
63. Limb (i) of the definition of VASP refers to any service in which VAs can be given in 
exchange for fiat currency or vice versa. If parties can pay for VAs using fiat currency 
or can pay using VAs for fiat currency, the offerer or provider of this service when 
acting as a business is a VASP. Similarly, in limb (ii), if parties can use one kind of VA 
as means of exchange or form of payment for another VA, the offerer or provider of 
this service when acting as a business is a VASP. It should be emphasized that limbs 
(i) and (ii) include the above activities, regardless of the role the service provider 
plays vis -à-vis its users as a principal, as a central counterparty for clearing or  
settling transactions, as an executing facility or as another intermediary facilitating 
the transaction. A VASP does not have to provide every element of the exchange or 
transfer in order to qualify as a VASP, so long as it conducts the exchange activity as 
a business on behalf of another natural or legal person.  
64. Limb (iii) in the definition of VASP covers any service allowing users to transfer 
ownership, or control of a VA to another user or to transfer VAs between VA 
addresses or accounts held by the sa me user. The FATF Standards define limb (iii) 
to mean “conduct[ing] a transaction on behalf of another natural or legal person that 
moves a virtual asset from one virtual asset address or account to another”. To help 
illustrate what this limb covers in practice, it is useful to consider the current nature 
of the VA following a purported transfer. If a new party has custody or ownership 
of the VA, has the ability to pass control of the VA to others, or has the ability to 
benefit from its use, then transfer h as likely occurred. This control does not 
necessarily have to be unilateral and multi-signature20 processes are not inherently 
exempt (see limb (iv) below), where a VASP undertakes the activity as a business 
on behalf of another natural or legal person. Similarly, if a person  maintains 
unilateral control of their assets  at all times , this may indicate that the service 
provider is not providing a qualifying service under limb (iii). However, it could still 
fall under limb (iii) where it actively facilitates the transfer (see paragraph 59). This 
also includes transfers between and among users of the same VASP, including where 
a VASP uses an off-chain internal record-keeping system and the VA remains in the 
same on-chain omnibus wallet or account. 
65. The limb is conceptually similar to what Recommendation 14 on money and value 
transfer services (MVTS) covers for financial assets .21 An example of a service 
covered by (iii) includes the function of actively facilitating or allowing users to send 
VAs to other individual s, as in a personal remittance payment, payment for non -
financial goods or services, or payment of wages. A provider offering such a service 
will likely be a VASP. 
66. Exchange or transfer services may also occur through technology commonly 
referred to as decentralized exchanges or platforms. A “decentralized or distributed 
application (DApp),” for example, is a term that refers to a software program that 
operates on a blockchain or similar technology . Sometimes, such applications 
facilitate or support other pr otocols, applications, or digital assets and their 
transfer. These applications or platforms often run on a decentralized ledger, but 
                                                      
20  In a multi -signature process or model, a person  needs several digital signatures (and 
therefore several private keys) to perform a transaction from a wallet.  
21  See Recommendation 14 in Section III for further information on MVTS obligations in the 
VASP context , including requirements that MVTS providers  include agents in their 
AML/CFT programmes and monitor them for compliance with these programmes . 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  27 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
often still have a central party with some measure of involvement  or control, such 
as creating and launching a VA, developing DApp functions and user interfaces for 
accounts holding an administrative “key” or collecting fees. Often, a DApp could be 
programmed to require a use r to pay a fee to interact with the DApp  which is 
commonly paid in VAs, for the ultimate benefit of th e 
owner/operator/developer/community. DApps can facilitate or conduct the 
exchange or transfer of VAs. Where these DApps offer financial services, such as 
those offered by VASPs, the term ‘decentralised finance’ (DeFi) is commonly used. 
67. A DeFi application  (i.e. the software program) is not a VASP under the FATF 
standards, as the Standards do not apply to underlying software or technology (see 
paragraph 82 below). However, creators , owners and operators  or some other 
persons who maintain control or sufficient influence in the DeFi arrangements, even 
if those arrangements seem decentralized, may fall under the FATF definition of a 
VASP where they are providing  or actively facilitating  VASP services . This is the 
case, even if other parties play a role in the se rvice or portions of the process are 
automated. Owners/operators can often be distinguished by their relationship to 
the activities being undertaken. For example, there may be  control or sufficient 
influence over assets or over aspects of the service’s protocol, and the existence of 
an ongoing  business relationship between themselves and users, even if this is 
exercised through a smart contract or in some cases voting protocols. Countries may 
wish to consider other factors as well, such as whether any party  profits from the 
service or has the ability to set or change parameters to identify the owner/operator 
of a DeFi arrangement. These are not the only characteristics that may make the 
owner/operator a VASP, but they are illustrative. Depending on its operation, there 
may also be additional VASPs that interact with a DeFi arrangement.  
68. Due to the global presence of the many open source projects and developmental 
contributors in this space, DeFi projects are rapidly expanding in their number and 
capabilities. While this Guidance aims to provide direction, countries will need to 
evaluate the facts and circumstances of each individual situation to determine 
whether there is an identifiable person (s), whether legal or natural, providing a 
covered service. Marketi ng terms or self -identification as a DeFi is not 
determinative, nor is the specific technology involved in determining if its owner or 
operator is a VASP. Countries should apply the principles contained in the Standards 
in a manner that interprets the definitions broadly, but with regard for the practical 
intent of the functional approach. It seems quite common for DeFi arrangements to 
call themselves decentralized when they actually include  a person with control or 
sufficient influence,  and jurisdictions s hould apply the VASP definition without 
respect to self -description. Countries should be guided by the principle that the 
FATF intends to cover natural or legal persons who conduct the financial services 
covered in the definition as a business.  If they mee t the definition of  VASPs, 
owners/operators should undertake ML/TF risk assessments prior to the launch or 
use of the software or platform and take appropriate measures to manage and 
mitigate these risks in an ongoing and forward-looking manner.22 In cases where a 
person can purchase governance tokens of a VASP, the VASP should retain the 
responsibility for satisfying AML/CFT obligations. An individual token holder in 
such a scenario does not have such  responsibility if the holder does not exercise 
                                                      
22  See Recommendation 15 in Section III below for further information on VASP’s obligations 
regarding new technologies.  
28  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
control or sufficient influence over the VASP activities undertaken as a business on 
behalf of others.  
69. Where it has not been possible to identify a legal or natural person with control or 
sufficient influence over a DeFi arrangement, there may not be a central 
owner/operator that meets the definition of a VASP. Countries should monitor for 
the emergence of risks posed by DeFi services and arrangements in such situations, 
including by engaging with representatives from their DeFi community. Countries 
should consider, where appropriate, any mitigating actions , where DeFi services 
operating in this manner are known to them. Such actions may be taken before the 
launch of the service or during the course of the DeFi services being offered, as 
necessary. As an example, where no VASP is identified, countries may consider the 
option of requiring that a regulated VASP be involved in activities related to the DeFi 
arrangement in line with the country’s RBA or other mitigants. Countries could also 
consider the ML/TF risks and p otential mitigating actions in relation to P2P as set 
out in this Guidance.23 
70. Other common VA services or business models may also constitute exchange or 
transfer activities based on items (i), (ii), and (iii) of the VASP definition. The natural 
or legal persons behind such services or models would be VASPs if they conduct or 
provide the activity as a business on behalf of another person. These can include:  
a. VA escrow services, including services involving smart contract technology, 
that VA buyers use to sen d, receive or transfer fiat currency in exchange for 
VAs, when the entity providing the service has custody over the funds;  
b. brokerage services that facilitate the issuance and trading of VAs on behalf of 
a natural or legal person’s users;  
c. order-book exch ange services, which bring together orders for buyers and 
sellers, typically by enabling users to find counterparties, discover prices, and 
trade, potentially through the use of a matching engine that matches the buy 
and sell orders from users. However, a platform which only allows buyers and 
sellers of VAs to find each other and does not undertake any of the services in 
the definition of a VASP would not be a VASP; and  
d. advanced trading services , which may allow users to access more 
sophisticated trading t echniques, such as trading on margin or algorithm -
based trading. 
71. Exchange and/or transfer business models can include VA exchanges or VA transfer 
services that facilitate the exchange of VA for fiat currency and/or other forms of VA 
for remuneration ( e.g., for a fee, commission, spread, or other benefit). These 
models typically accept a wide range of payment methods, including cash, wires, 
credit cards, and VAs. Traditional VA exchange or transfer services can be 
administrator-affiliated, non -affiliated, or  a third -party provider. Providers of 
kiosks—often called “ATMs”, “bitcoin teller machines”, “bitcoin ATMs” or “vending 
machines”—may also fall into the above definitions because they provide or actively 
facilitate covered VA activities via physical electr onic terminals (the kiosks) that 
enable the owner/operator to facilitate the exchange of VAs for fiat currency or 
other VAs and/or the exchange of fiat currency for VAs.

© FATF/OECD 2021 
Safekeeping and/or administration24  
72. Limb (iv) of the VASP definition should also be read expansively. Any entity that has 
the ability to exercise control over VAs may qualify under limb (iv) as this is the 
conceptual meaning of the words “administration” and “safekeeping”. In simplest 
terms, “safekeeping” consists of the service of holding a VA or the private keys to 
the VA on behalf of a nother person. The term “administration” could also include 
the concept of managing VAs for or on behalf of another person.  
73. The term “control” should be understood as the ability to hold, trade, transfer  or 
spend the VA. Parties that can use a VA or change its disposition have control of it. 
As in the definition of “transfer”, this does not mean the control must be unilateral. 
“Control” can include circumstances where keys or credentials held by others are 
required in order to change the assets disposition, such as multi -signature 
processes. The existence of a multi -signature model or models in which multiple 
parties must use keys for a transaction to happen does not mean a particular entity 
does not maintain control, depending on the extent of the influence it may have over 
the VAs. This explanation of control also holds for interpreting ‘enabling control’ in 
the definition of limb (iv).  
74. This limb of the definition would include, for example, most custodial wallet service 
providers because they hold and/or keep VAs on behalf of another person. Those 
who may offer escrow services, such as lawyers, should consider whether they 
provide this service frequently as a business and whether the elements of control 
are actually offered by themselves or by a party to whom they outsource the control, 
such as a custodial wallet service provider to which they consign the VAs. Providing 
the functions outlined in the definition should be the determining factor in 
identifying a VASP rather than a categorization as a lawyer. When in doubt, the plain 
language of the definitions should be interpreted flexibly to encompass any entity 
that provides control of VAs for or on behalf of another person.  
75. In the context of limb (iv) of th e VASP definition, countries should account for 
services or business models that provide the function of safeguarding the person’s 
VAs or the power to manage or transfer the VAs, under the assumption that such 
management and transmission will only be done according to the owner’s/ user’s 
instructions. Safekeeping and administration services could include persons that 
have control of the private key associated with VAs belonging to another person or 
control of smart contracts to which they are not a party that involve VAs belonging 
to another person. 
76. Firms which merely provide ancillary infrastructure to allow another entity to offer 
this service, such as cloud data storage providers or integrity service providers 
responsible for verifying the accuracy of sign atures, will not normally satisfy this 
definition. Nor does this limb typically cover software developers or providers of 
unhosted wallets  whose functions are only developing and/or selling the 
software//hardware.25 However, countries must look at individua l facts and 
circumstances in applying the definition for specific cases. 
                                                      
24  The terminology used  in this section (such as “safekeeping”, “administration” and 
“ancillary services”) are used and interpreted in the context of VAs/VASPs. They should 
not confused with the usage of such terms in other situations (e .g. in relation to banking 
and other traditional financial instruments or services).

Participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer’s offer 
and/or sale 
77. The FATF definition of VASP is intended to cover activities related to ICOs. ICOs are 
generally a means to raise funds for new projects from early backers. Limb (v) in 
particular covers persons who participate in, or provide related financial services 
to, issuers’ offer and/or sale of VAs through activities such as ICOs. Such persons 
may be affiliated or unaffiliated with the issuer undertaking the ICO in the context 
of the issuance, offer, sale, distribution, ongoing market circulation and trading of a 
VA. For example, this could include businesses accepting purchase orders and funds 
and purchasing VAs from an issuer to resell and distribute the funds or assets, as 
well as book building, underwriting, market making and placement agent activity, 
etc. Other limbs of the VASP definition may also be relevant to businesses involved 
in ICOs. The natu ral and legal persons involved in the issuance can also provide 
services that involve exchange, transfer or safekeeping activity under limbs (i)-(iv) 
of the VASP definition. This is particularly relevant for issuers of VAs who issue the 
VA and offer/sell the VA through activities such as ICOs. 
78. For clarity, the sole act of issuing a VA26, entirely on its own, is not a covered service 
under limb (v) of the VASP definition. However, any persons which conduct the 
exchange and transfer of the issued VAs as a busi ness for or on behalf of another 
person would be a covered service, as would the participation in and the provision 
of financial services related to any ICO associated with the issuance. The discrete act 
of creating VA software to issue a VA does not make the creator a VASP, unless the 
creator also performs the covered functions mentioned in the definition as a 
business for or on behalf of another person.  
79. A jurisdiction’s applicable AML/CFT obligations governing service providers that 
participate in or provide financial services relating to an issuer’s issuance, offer, sale 
and/or distribution, such as in the context of ICOs, may involve one or more of a 
country’s AML/CFT and non -AML/CFT regulations, such as in relation to money 
transmission, securities, commodities, and/or derivatives activities.  
Box 2. Example of characteristics of initial coin offerings (ICOs) 
Digital assets can be issued and/or transferred using distributed ledger 
or blockchain technology. One mechanism for distributing such assets is 
through an event commonly referred to as an ICO. In an ICO, an issuer or 
promoter typically offers a digital asset for sale in exchange for fiat 
currency or another VA. ICOs typically are announced and promoted 
online through various marketing materials. Issuers or promoters often 
release a “white paper” describing the project and promoting the ICO. 
Issuers or promoters may tell prospective purchasers that the capital 
raised from the sales will be used to fund development of a digital 
platform, software, or other projects and that, at some point, the digital 
asset may itself be used to access the platform, use the software, or 
otherwise participate in the project.  During the offering, issuers or 
                                                      
26  Issuance in this context means the creation of a VA, to be distinguished from the offer 
and/or sale of the VA related to the issuance of that VA. 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  31

promoters may lead purchasers of the digital asset to expect a return on 
their investment or to participate in a share of the returns provided by 
the project. After they are issued, the digital assets may be resold to 
others in a secondary market ( e.g., on digital asset trading platforms or 
through VASPs).  
In determining how the definition of VASP applies to entities in an ICO, 
it is the facts and circumstances underlying an asset, activity or service 
that will determine the categorization, rather than any labels or 
terminology used by market participants. For example, a person creates 
a digital asset that meets the definition of a VA. The person sells the VA 
to purchasers, even though the VA itself may be delivered to the 
purchaser at a later date and the business uses the value received from 
the sale to develop the platform or ecosystem in which the VA eventually 
may be used.  In this scenario, the person selling the VA is a VASP  if in 
addition to the issuance itself, it conducts other activities that fall under 
any limb of the VASP definition (e.g. if they are exchanging the VA for fiat 
currency or other VAs  (limbs (i) and (ii)) or if they are providing 
liquidity in the VA by acting as a market -maker following the ICO (limb 
(v)). Businesses providing related financial services to the person’s sale 
of the VA (e.g., by acting as a broker or dealer for the person), would then 
be a VASP under limb (v) of the VASP definition , regardless of whether 
they are formally affiliated with the person. It does not matter whether 
the customer intends to use the VA as an investment or as  means of 
payment. 
Alternatively, the digital asset in the above example may be considered 
to be a security under the laws of a country. In this circumstance, 
depending on the facts and circumstances , a country’s securities laws  
may apply . Therefore, wheth er the issuer of the digital asset will be 
considered a VASP or an issuer of securities will depend on the unique 
facts and circumstances of the ICO and the laws of the country. Other 
jurisdictions may also have a different approach which may include 
payment tokens. A person may be engaged in activity that may subject 
them to more than one type of regulatory framework, and the digital 
assets used by such a person may similarly be subject to more than one 
type of regulatory framework. 
Scope of the definitions  
80. Despite the many and frequently changing marketing terms and innovative 
business models developed in this sector, the FATF envisions very few VA 
arrangements without VASPs involved at some stage if countries apply the 
definition correctly. Countries should take particular care to assess any claims that 
businesses may make as to models of decentralization or distributed services, and 
conduct their own assessment of the business model in line with its risk and their 
ability to mitigate these risks. 
81. As previously stated, the FATF Standards are technology neutral. As such, the FATF 
does not seek to regulate the technology that underlies VAs or VASP activities. 
Rather the FATF seeks to regulate natural or legal persons behind such technologies 
32  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
that conduct as a business the aforementioned VASP activities on behalf of another 
natural or legal person.  
82. A person that creates or sells a software application or a VA platform (i.e., a software 
developer) may therefore not constitute a VASP, when solely creating or selling the 
application or platform. Using the application or platform to engage in VASP 
functions, as a business on behalf of others, however, would change this 
determination. In addition, a party directing the creation and development of the 
software or platform, so that they can provide VASP services as a business for or on 
behalf of another person, likely also qualifies as a VASP, in particular if they retain 
control or sufficient influence over the assets, software, protocol, or platform or any 
ongoing business relationship with users of the software  even if this is exercised 
through a smart contract. Such a VASP is therefore responsible for complying with 
the relevant AML/CFT obligations.  As such, they should undertake ML/TF risk 
assessments prior to th e launch or use of the software or platform and take 
appropriate measures to mitigate the risks  in an ongoing and forward -looking 
manner. 
83. The FATF also does not seek to regulate as VASPs natural or legal persons that 
provide ancillary services or products to a VA network. This includes the provision 
of ancillary services like hardware wallet manufacturers or providers of unhosted 
wallets, to the extent that they do not also engage in or actively facilitate as a 
business any of the aforementioned covered VA activities or operations  for or on 
behalf of another person. Likewise, natural or legal persons that solely engage in the 
operation of a VA network and do not engage in or facilitate any of the activities or 
operations of a VASP on behalf of their customer s (e.g., offering internet network 
services and infrastructure, offering computing resources such as cloud services 
and creating, validating, and broadcasting blocks of transactions) are not VASPs 
under the FATF Standards, even if they conduct those activities as a business.  
84. Just as the FATF does not seek to regulate the individual users (not acting as a 
business) of VAs as VASPs—though recognizing that such users may still be subject 
to compliance obligations under a jurisdiction’s sanctions or enforcemen t 
framework—the FATF similarly does not seek to capture the types of closed -loop 
items that are non-transferable, non-exchangeable, and cannot be used for payment 
or investment purposes. Such items might include airline miles, credit card awards, 
or simila r loyalty program rewards or points, which an individual cannot sell 
onward in a secondary market outside of the closed-loop system. Rather, the VA and 
VASP definitions are intended to capture specific financial activities and operations 
(i.e., transfer, e xchange, safekeeping and administration, and the provision of 
financial services associated with issuance, etc.) and assets that are convertible or 
interchangeable at a market rate—whether virtual-to-virtual, virtual-to-fiat or fiat-
to-virtual. The accepta nce of VAs as payment for goods and services, as in the 
acceptance of VA by a merchant when effecting the purchase of goods, for instance, 
also does not constitute a VASP activity. A service that facilitates companies 
accepting VA as payment would, however, be a VASP.  
85. AML/CFT regulations will apply to covered VA activities and VASPs, regardless of 
the type of VA involved in the financial activity (e.g., a VASP that uses or offers AECs 
to another person  for various financial transactions), the underlying te chnology 
(e.g., whether it uses mainnet or the use of embedded layering or other scaling 
solutions), or the additional services that the platform potentially incorporates 
(such as a mixer or tumbler or other potential features for obfuscation)

86. For stableco ins, there are a range of the entities involved in any stablecoin 
arrangement. Stablecoins may have a central developer or governance body.  A 
governance body consists of one or more natural or legal persons who establish or 
participate in the establishment of the rules governing the stablecoin arrangement 
(e.g., determine the functions of the stablecoin, who can access the arrangement and 
whether/how AML/CFT preventive measures are built into the arrangement). They 
may also carry out the basic functions of  the stablecoin arrangement (such as 
managing the stabilization function) or this may be delegated to other entities. They 
may also manage the integration of the stablecoin into telecommunications 
platforms or promote adherence to common rules across the s tablecoin 
arrangement.  
87. Where such a central body exists in a stablecoin arrangement, they will, in general, 
be covered by the FATF Standards either as a  FI or a VASP. This is particularly the 
case if the governance body carries out other functions in the stablecoin 
arrangement. Such a body should therefore undertake ML/TF risk assessments 
prior to the launch or use of the stablecoin and take appropriate measures to 
manage and mitigate risks across the arrangement before launch.27  
88. Not all stablecoins may have a readily identified central body which is a VASP or a 
FI. However, it may be more likely that a party needs to exist to drive the 
development and launch of such an arrangement before its release. If this entity was 
a business and carried out VASP funct ions, this would create scope for regulatory 
or supervisory action in the pre -launch phase. If there is not a clearly identifiable 
VASP or FI , a country should carefully consider the risks that a given stablecoin 
poses and the need for mitigation measures, if any (see, for example, the mitigation 
measures for P2P transactions in paragraphs 105 -106). Additionally, this is not 
meant to implicate those only developing software code, but rather the persons 
involved in stablecoin arrangements that conduct or pro vide financial services 
covered by the limbs of the VASP definition.  
89. A range of other entities in the stablecoin arrangement may also have AML/CFT 
obligations, such as exchanges or custodial wallet services.  To demonstrate this, a 
hypothetical case study is set out in Box 3. It is important to note that the exact 
details of any arrangement must receive independent scrutiny to make these 
determinations.28  
                                                      
27  See Recommendation 15 in Section III below for further information on VASP’s 
obligations regarding new technologies.  This is also consistent with the case of "New 
payment products and services (NPSS)" providers in the FATF's report on prepaid cards, 
mobile payments and internet -based payment services for further information: 
www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Guidance-RBA-NPPS.pdf.

stablecoin arrangement are set out in the FATF Report to G20 on So-Called Stablecoins.

Box 3. Hypothetical case study of a stablecoin arrangement and the 
application of the FATF Standards 
Scenario29 
A company (“Company”) is designing a distributed ledger technology -
based platform to issue a digital asset that is intended to act as a 
stablecoin (“Coin”). 
The Coin will be backed by assets that are held in accounts at a number 
of global FIs (coll ectively, the “ Reserve Fund”), that is managed by the 
Company. The Coin’s market value will be maintained in line with the 
value of the assets held in the Reserve Fund through the Authorised 
Participant mechanism. Only Authorised Participants will be able to 
purchase or redeem Coins from the Reserve Fund through the Company. 
Under the Company’s proposed ecosystem, the Company and third 
parties (collectively, the "Validators") will operate a permissioned  
blockchain network using other third parties' cloud in frastructure. The 
Company is raising funds for the Coin through an ICO.  
The Company, third parties and individual users will be able to 
access, use and transact with the Coin. To connect to the network, any 
third parties, such as trading platforms and cus todial wallet providers, 
will need to obtain approval from the Company. Coin wallets will permit 
users to send, receive and store the Coin, and any developers/third 
parties can offer their customized wallets. Coins will be transferred 
following the rules defined by the Company and assessed by regulators 
before commencing operation. Merchants will also be able to use the 
Coin as payment for goods and services.  
Obliged Entities and their AML/CFT obligations under the FATF 
Standards.  
The Company in this Scenario is a VASP or FI under the FATF Standards 
as its functions include exchanging the Coin with Authorised 
Participants, including through its raising of funds through the ICO. The 
Company will have AML/CFT obligations in addition to those of other 
third-parties with AML/CFT obligations in the ecosystem. Under the 
FATF Standards, the Company should take appropriate measures to 
mitigate the ML/TF risks across the ecosystem (e.g. in the design of the 
Coin, the criteria and process for approving Authorised Par ticipants, 
etc.). 
Authorised Participants  are also VASPs as their function includes 
facilitating the issuance, distribution, and trading of VAs. Trading 
platforms are VASPs as their functions include exchanging between the 
Coins and fiat currencies  and oth er VAs , transferring Coins, and 
safekeeping and /or administration of the Coins . Custodial wallet 
providers are VASPs as their functions include transferring Coins and 
safekeeping and/or administration of Coins.  
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  35 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
Participants in the ecosystem who do not fal l under the definition of 
VASPs in the FATF Standards include; the global FIs whose functions are 
only managing the Reserve Fund (although they are covered under the 
FATF Standards as FIs); Validators, except for the Company, whose 
functions are only valid ating transactions; cloud service providers 
whose functions are only offering the operation of infrastructure; 
manufacturers of hardware wallets whose functions are only 
manufacturing and selling the devices; software providers of unhosted 
wallets whose fu nctions are only developing and /or selling the 
software/hardware; merchants which are only providing goods and 
services in exchange for Coins; software developers who do not 
undertaken any VASP functions; and individual users.  
It is important to note that  the exact details of any arrangement must 
receive prior adequate and independent scrutiny to make these 
determinations and the exact application of AML/CFT measures will 
depend on each individual country. This is an illustrative example only 
and not all s tablecoins are organized in this way . Depending on the 
individual country, laws relating to financial assets such as securities, 
commodities and derivatives may be implicated in this scenario as well. 
Countries can also adopt other measures if they conside r the ML/TF 
risks are unacceptably high, such as in relation to potential P2P 
transactions (see paragraphs 105-106 for further information on what 
measures countries could take). 
90. Some platforms and providers offer the ability to conduct VA transfers direc tly 
between individual users. For such platforms, the broad reading of the definitions 
above will decide whether parties to providing such a service are VASPs on a 
functional basis, not on the basis of self -description or technology employed. Only 
entities that provide very limited functionality falling short of exchange, transfer, 
safekeeping, administration, control, and the provision of financial services 
associated with issuance will generally not be a VASP. For example, this may include 
websites which offer only a forum for buyers and sellers to identify and 
communicate with each other without offering, even in part, those services which 
are included in the definition of VASP.   
91. For self -described P2P platforms, jurisdictions should focus on the underly ing 
activity, not the label or business model. Some kinds of “matching” or “finding” 
services may also qualify as VASPs even if not interposed in the transaction. The 
FATF takes an expansive view of the definitions of VA and VASP and considers most 
arrangements currently in operation, even if they self-categorize as P2P platforms, 
may have at least some party involved at some stage of the product’s development 
and launch that constitutes a VASP. Automating a process that has been designed to 
provide covered services for a business does not relieve the controlling party of 
obligations.    
                                                      
29  The scenario included in this case study is adapted from the case study included in 
IOSCO’s March 2020 report on Global Stablecoin Initiatives. It has been amended to fit the 
AML/CFT context . This example is provided to illustrate obligations of persons in a 
hypothetical stablecoin arrangement and is not meant to be exhaustive.  
36  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
92. The determination of whether a service provider meets the definition of a VASP 
should take into account the lifecycle of products and services. Launching a service 
that will  provide VASP services, for instance, imposes VASP obligations, even if 
those functions will proceed automatically in the future, especially if the provider 
will maintain some measure of control  or sufficient influence , by, for example, 
setting parameters, holding an administrative key, retaining access to the platform 
or collecting fees or realiz ing profits. The use of an automated process such as a 
smart contract to carry out VASP functions does not relieve the part (ies) of 
responsibility for VASP obligations. In such instances, controlling parties qualifying 
as VASPs should undertake ML/TF risk assessments prior to the launch or use of 
the platform and take appropriate measures to mitigate risks. This could include 
effectively delegating implementation of AML/CFT obligations to another natural or 
legal person involved in the platform.  
93. The FATF recognises however that an expansive approach can bring practical 
challenges to competent authorities in identifying which entities are VASPs and 
defining their reg ulatory perimeter.  When there is a need to assess a particular 
entity to determine whether it is a VASP or evaluate a business model where VASP 
status is unclear, a few general questions can help guide the answer. Among these 
would be who profits from the use of the service or asset, who established and can 
change the rules, who can make decisions affecting operations, who generated and 
drove the creation and launch of a product or service, who maintains an ongoing 
business relationship with a contracting party or another person who possesses and 
controls the data on its operations, and who could shut down the product or service. 
Individual situations will vary and this list is not definitive and offers only some 
examples.  
94. The FATF Standards, including the definitions of virtual assets and VASPs, represent 
a minimum standard for countries to introduce. In line with the RBA, countries may 
choose to extend their AML/CFT regimes to include other digital assets and entities, 
beyond the FATF definition of virtual asset and VASP. Such a determination should 
be made on the basis of a ML/TF risk assessment, with consideration of the 
challenges associated with regulatory divergence.

PART THREE: 
APPLICATION OF FATF STANDARDS TO COUNTRIES AND 
COMPETENT AUTHORITIES 
95. Section III explains how the FATF Recommendations relating to VAs and VASPs 
apply to countries and competent authorities and focuses on identifying and 
mitigating the risks associated with covered VA activities, applying preventive 
measures, applying licensing and registration requirements, implementing effective 
supervision on par with the supervision of related financial activities of FIs, 
providing a range of effective and dissuasive sanctions, and facilitating national and 
international co-operation. Almost all of the FATF Recommendations are directly 
relevant for understanding how countries should use government authorities and 
international co -operation to address the ML/TF risks associated with VAs and 
VASPs, while other Recommendations are less directly or explicitly linked to VAs or 
VASPs, though they are still relevant and applicable. 
96. VAs and VASPs are subject to the full range of obligations under the FATF 
Recommendations, as described in INR. 15, including those obligations applicable 
to other entities subject to AML/CFT regulation, based on the financial activities in 
which VASPs engage and having regard to the ML/TF risks associated with covered 
VA activities or operations. 
97. This section also reviews the application of the RBA by supervisors of VASPs.  
Application of the Recommendations in the Context of VAs and VASPs 
Risk-Based Approach and National Co-ordination 
98. Recommendation 1.  The FATF Recommendations make clear that countries 
should apply a RBA to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate ML/TF risks are 
commensurate with the risks identified in their respective jurisdictions. Under the 
RBA, countries should strengthen the requirements for higher -risk situations or 
activities involving VAs. When assessing the ML/TF risks associated with VAs, the 
particular types of VA financial activities, such as P2P transactions for instance, and 
the activities or operations of VASPs, the distinction between centralized and 
decentralized VAs and whether they are subject to control by a regulated VASP, will 
likely continue to be a key aspect for countries to consider. Due to the potential for 
increased anonymity or obfuscation of VA financial flows and the challenges 
associated with conducting effective supervision and CDD, including customer 
identification and verification, VAs and VASPs in general may be regarded as posing 
higher ML/TF risks that may potentially require the application of monitoring and 
enhanced due diligence (EDD) measures, where appropriate, depending on the 
country’s context. 
38  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
99. Recommendation 1 requires countries to identify, understand, and assess their 
ML/TF risks and to take action aimed at effectively mitigating those risks. The 
requirement applies in relation to the risks associated with new technologies under 
Recommendation 15, including VAs and the risks associated with VASPs that engage 
in or provide covered VA activities, operations, products, or services. Public-private 
sector co -operation may assist competent authorities in developing AML/CFT 
policies for covered VA activities (e.g., VA payments, VA transfers, VA issuance, etc.) 
as well as for innovations in related VA technologies and emerging products and 
services, where appropriate and applicable. Co-operation may also assist countries 
in allocating and prioritizing AML/CFT resources by competent authorities. 
100. The FATF amended Recommendation 1 and its Interpretive Note in October 2020 
to include a requirement for countries, FIs and DNFBPs to assess proliferation 
financing (PF) risks as defined under the Standards. In June 2021, the FATF 
amended the Interpretive Note to Recommendation 15 to clarify that these PF 
requirements also apply to VASPs. To clarify these requirements, the FATF released 
Guidance on Proliferation Financing Risk Assessment and Mitigation  in June 2021. 
That guidance is relevant for the assessment and mitigation of PF risks by countries 
and VASPs. Countries should identify , assess and take effective action to mitigate 
the ML/TF/PF risks related to VAs.   
101. National authorities should undertake a co -ordinated risk assessment of VA 
activities, products, and services, as well as of the risks associated with VASPs and 
the overall VASP sector in their country. The risk assessment should (i) enable all 
relevant authorities to understand how specific VA products and services function, 
fit into, and affect all relevant regulatory jurisdictions for AML/CFT purposes ( e.g., 
money transmission and payment mechanisms, VA kiosks, commodities, securities 
or related issuance activities, etc., as highlighted in the VASP definition) and (ii) 
promote similar AML/CFT treatment for similar products and services with similar 
risk profiles. In undert aking a risk assessment, including individuals who are 
knowledgeable on VAs, VASPs and their underlying technology is especially 
important. 
102. As the VASP sector evolves, countries should consider examining the relationship 
between AML/CFT measures for covere d VA activities and other regulatory and 
supervisory measures ( e.g., consumer and investor protection, prudential safety 
and soundness, network IT security, tax, etc.), as the measures taken in other fields 
may affect the ML/TF risks. In this regard, count ries should consider undertaking 
short- and longer -term policy work to develop comprehensive regulatory and 
supervisory frameworks for covered VA activities and VASPs (as well as other 
obliged entities operating in the VA space) as widespread adoption of V As 
continues. 
103. Countries should also require VASPs (as well as other obliged entities) to identify, 
assess, and take effective action to mitigate the ML/TF risks associated with 
providing or engaging in covered VA activities or associated with offering particular 
VA products or services. Where VASPs are permitted under national law, countries, 
VASPs, as well as FIs and DNFBPs —including FIs or DNFBPs that engage in VA 
activities or provide VA products or services —must assess the associated ML/TF 
risks and apply a RBA to ensure that appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate 
those risks are implemented.  
104. As with VAs, it is important that ML/TF risks of stablecoins, particularly those with 
potential for mass-adoption and that can be used for P2P transactions, are analysed 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  39 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
in an ongoing and forward-looking manner. In developing new products, VASPs and 
other obliged entities should assess the ML/TF risks before bringing them to market 
and put in place mitigation measures before launch. Potential mitigation measures 
could include, for example, limiting the scope of users’ ability to transact 
anonymously, controlling who can access the arrangement, controlling 
whether/how AML/CFT preventive measures are built into the arrangement  
and/or by ensuring that AML/CFT oblig ations of obliged entities within the 
arrangement are fulfilled, e.g. by using software to monitor transactions and detect 
suspicious activity. Supervisors should look for these mitigation measures to be in 
place before granting registration/licensing and on an ongoing basis. It will be more 
difficult to mitigate risks of these products once they are launched. 
P2P transactions 
105. As set out in Section 2, countries should also seek to understand the ML/TF risks 
related to P2P transactions and how they are being  used in their jurisdiction. 
Measures that countries should consider to assist in understanding the risks of P2P 
transactions include: 
a. conducting outreach to the private sector, including VASPs and 
representatives from the P2P sector (e.g. consulting on AM L/CFT 
requirements concerning P2P transactions); 
b. training of supervisory, financial intelligence unit (FIU) and law enforcement 
personnel; and 
c. encouraging the development of methodologies and tools, such as blockchain 
analytics, to collect and assess P2P m arket metrics and risk mitigation 
solutions, risk methodologies to identify suspicious behaviour, and determine 
whether wallets are hosted or unhosted, 30 including by engaging with 
programmers/developers in this space. 
106. Depending on the assessed risks associated with P2P transactions, or certain types 
of P2P transactions, countries may consider and implement as appropriate options 
to mitigate these risks at a national level. These measures may include: 
a. controls that facilitate visibility of P2P activity and/o r VA activity crossing 
between obliged entities and non -obliged entities (these controls could 
include VA equivalents to currency transaction reports or a record -keeping 
rule relating to such transfers);31 
b. ongoing risk-based enhanced supervision of VASPs and entities operating in 
the VA space with a specific focus on unhosted wallet transactions ( e.g., on-
site and off-site supervision to confirm whether a VASP has complied with the 
regulations in place concerning these transactions); 
c. obliging VASPs to facilitate transactions only to/from addresses/sources that 
have been deemed acceptable in line with their RBA; 
                                                      
30  To date, the FATF is not aware of any technically proven means of identifying the VASP 
that manages the beneficiary  wallet exhaustively, precisely, and accurately in all 
circumstances and from the VA address alone. 
31  Such reporting requirements are similar to the reporting requirements the FATF places 
on cross -border physical large cash transfers by individuals to add ress the associated 
ML/TF risks by these types of transactions (Recommendation 32).  
40  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
d. obliging VASPs to facilitate transactions only to/from VASPs and other 
obliged entities;  
e. placing additional AML/CFT requirements on VASPs that allow transactions 
to/from non -obliged entities ( e.g., enhanced recordkeeping requirements, 
EDD requirements); 
f. guidance highlighting the importance of VASPs applying a RBA to dealing 
with customers that engage in, or facilitate, P2P transactions, supported by 
risk assessment, indicators or typologies publications where appropriate ; 
and 
g. issuing public guidance and advisories and conducting information 
campaigns to raise awareness of risks posed by P2P transactions ( e.g., 
accounting for specific risks posed by P2P transactions through the 
assessment of specific users, patterns of observed conduct, local and regional 
risks, and information from regulators and law enforcement). 
107. In addition to P2P transactions, the FATF has identified other potential risks which 
may require further action, including; VA SPs located in jurisdictions with weak or 
non-existent AML/CFT frameworks (which have not properly implement ed 
AML/CFT preventive measures) and VAs with decentralised governance structures 
(which may not include an interm ediary that could apply AML/CFT measures). 32 
These risks may require countries or VASPs to identify VASP - or country-specific 
risks and implement specific safeguards for transactions that have a nexus to VASPs 
and countries lacking in regulation, supervisio n, or appropriate controls  based on 
these risks. These risks are particularly heightened if there is mass-adoption.33  
Prohibition or limitation of VAs/VASPs 
108. A jurisdiction has the discretion to prohibit or limit VA activities or VASPs, and those 
VA activities carried out by non-obliged entities, based on their assessment of risk 
and national regulatory context or in order to support other policy goals not 
addressed in this Guidance ( e.g., consumer and investor protection, safety and 
soundness, or monetary policy). This can include a general ban or limitation on the 
activity, or specific bans or limitations on products or services which are deemed to 
pose an unacceptable level of ML/TF risk. Such a prohibition or limitation should be 
in law or enforceable means.  
109. In deciding whether to prohibit or limit VA activities or VASPs, countries should 
understand the ML/TF risks associated with VAs and VASPs. Countries should also 
take into account the effect that such a prohibition may have on their ML/TF risks. 
Regardless of whether a country opts to prohibit, limit or regulate activities in the 
sector, additional measures may be useful in mitigating the overall ML/TF risks. For 
example, if a country prohibits VA activities and VASPs, mitigation measures should 
include identifying VASPs (or other obliged entities that may engage in VA 
activities) that operate illegally in the jurisdiction and applying proportionate and 
dissuasive sanctions to such entities, and assess the risk that services will be offered 
in that coun try by a VASP based abroad. Based on the country’s risk profile, 
prohibition/limitation should still require outreach and enforcement actions by the 
                                                      
32  See the FATF’s report to G20 on so-called stablecoins for further information.   
33  See paragraph 40  for further information about the ML/TF risks related to mass -
adoption and P2P.

country as well as risk mitigation strategies that account for the cross -border 
element of VA activities ( e.g., cross -border VA payments or transfers) and VASP 
operations. Countries should periodically revisit the risk assessment basis 
underpinning this decision, as the associated ML/TF risks and the ability to enforce 
such a prohibition/limitation may evolve rapidly. 
110. Recommendation 2 requires national co-operation and co-ordination with respect 
to AML/CFT/CPF policies, including in the VASP sector, and is therefore indirectly 
applicable to countries in the context of regulating and supervising covered VA 
activities. Countries should consider putting in place mechanisms, such as 
interagency working groups or task forces, to enable policymakers, regulators, 
supervisors, the FIU, and law enforcement authorities to co -operate with one 
another and any other relevant competent authorities in order to develop and 
implement effective policies, regulations, and other measures to address the 
ML/TF/PF risks associated with covered VA activities and VASPs. This should 
include co-operation and co-ordination between relevant authorities to ensure the 
compatibility of AML/CFT requirements with data protection and privacy rules and 
other similar provisions (e.g., data security/localisation). National co-operation and 
co-ordination are particularly important in the context of VAs,  in part due to their 
highly-mobile and cross-border nature and because of the manner in which covered 
or regulated VA activities may implicate multiple regulatory bodies ( e.g., those 
competent authorities regulating money transmission, securities, and commodities 
or derivatives activities). Further, national co-operation relating to VA issues is vital 
in the context of furthering investigations and leveraging various interagency tools 
relevant for addressing the cyber and/or VA ecosystem. 
Treatment of Virtual Assets: Interpreting the Funds- or Value-Based Terms  
111. For the purposes of applying the FATF Recommendations, countries should 
consider all funds - or value -based terms in the Recommendations, such as 
“property,” “proceeds,” “funds,” “funds or other asse ts,” and other “corresponding 
value,” as including VAs. In particular, countries should apply the relevant measures 
under Recommendations 3 through 8, 30, 33, 35, and 38, all of which contain 
references to the aforementioned funds - or value -based terms or other similar 
terms, in the context of VAs in order to prevent the misuse of VAs in ML, TF, and PF 
and take action against all proceeds of crime involving VAs. The aforementioned 
Recommendations—some of which may not at first appear directly applicable to 
VASPs and similarly obliged entities but are in fact applicable in this space —relate 
to the ML offence, confiscation and provisional measures, TF offence, targeted 
financial sanctions, non -profit organisations, law enforcement powers, sanctions, 
and international co-operation. 
112. Recommendation 3. For the purposes of implementing Recommendation 3, the ML 
offence should extend to any type of property, regardless of its value, that directly 
represents the proceeds of crime, including in the context of VAs. When proving that 
property is the proceeds of crime, it should not be necessary that a person be 
convicted of a predicate offence, including in the case of VA -related proceeds. 
Countries should therefore extend their applicable ML offence measures to 
proceeds of crime involving VAs.  
113. Recommendation 4. Similarly, the confiscation and provisional measures relating 
to “(a) property laundered, (b) proceeds from, or instrumentalities used in or 
intended for use in money laundering or predicate offences, (c) property that is the 
42  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
proceeds of, or used in, or intended or allocated for use in, the financing of terrorism, 
terrorist acts, or terrorist organisations, (d) or property of corresponding value” 
also apply to VAs. 
114. As for confiscation or temporary measures applicable to fiat currencies and goods, 
law enforcement authorities should be able to request a temporary freeze of assets 
when there are grounds to establish or when it is established, that they originate 
from criminal activity. To extend the duration of the free ze or to request the 
confiscation of assets, law enforcement authorities should obtain a court order. 
115. Recommendation 5. Likewise, the TF offences described in Recommendation 5 
should extend to “any funds or other assets,” including VAs, whether from a 
legitimate or illegitimate source (see INR. 5). 
116. Recommendation 6. Countries should also freeze without delay the funds or other 
assets—including VAs—of designated persons or entities and ensure that no funds 
or other assets —including VAs —are made available to or for the benefit of 
designated persons or entities in relation to the targeted financial sanctions related 
to terrorism and TF. 
117. Recommendation 7.  In the context of targeted financial sanctions related to 
proliferation, countries should freeze without del ay the funds or other assets —
including VAs—of designated persons or entities and ensure that no funds or others 
assets—including VAs —are made available to or for the benefit of designated 
persons or entities. 
118. Recommendation 8. Countries also should apply m easures, in line with the RBA, 
to protect non-profit organisations from TF abuse, as laid out in Recommendation 
8, including when the clandestine diversion of funds to terrorist organisations 
involves VAs (see Recommendation 8(c)). 
119. Recommendation 30 applies to covered VA activities and VASPs in the context of 
the applicability of all funds - or value-based terms addressed in paragraph 111 of 
this Guidance. As with other types of property or proceeds of crime, countries 
should ensure that competent authoritie s have responsibility for expeditiously 
identifying, tracing, and initiating actions to freeze and seize VA -related property 
that is, or may become, subject to confiscation or is suspected of being the proceeds 
of crime. Countries should implement Recommen dation 30, regardless of how the 
jurisdiction classifies VAs in its national legal framework (i.e., regardless of how VAs 
are categorized legally with respect to the property laws of the jurisdiction). 
120. Recommendation 33.  The statistics that countries maint ain should include 
statistics on the STRs that the competent authorities receive and disseminate as 
well as on the property that the competent authorities freeze, seize, and confiscate. 
Countries should therefore also implement Recommendation 33 in the con text of 
VASPs and VA activities and maintain statistics on the STRs that competent 
authorities receive from VASPs and from other obliged entities, such as banks, that 
submit STRs relating to VASPs, VAs, or VA activities. As with other 
Recommendations that contain funds - or value -based terms ( e.g., 
Recommendations 3 through 8, 30, 35, and 38), countries should also maintain 
statistics on any VAs that competent authorities freeze, seize, or confiscate, 
regardless of how the jurisdiction categorizes VAs with respect to the property laws 
of its national legal framework. Additionally, countries should consider updating 
their STRs and associated statistics to incorporate VA -related indicators that 
facilitate investigations and financial analysis. 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  43 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
121. Recommendation 35 directs countries to have a range of effective, proportionate 
and dissuasive sanctions (criminal, civil or administrative) available to deal with 
natural or legal persons covered by Recommendations 6 and 8 to 23 that fail to 
comply with the applicable AML/CFT requirements. As required by paragraph 6 of 
INR. 15, countries should similarly have in place sanctions to deal with VASPs (and 
other obliged entities that engage in VA activities) that fail to comply with their 
AML/CFT requirements. As with FIs and DNFBPs and other natural or legal persons, 
such sanctions should be applicable not only to VASPs but also to their directors and 
senior management, where applicable. 
122. Recommendation 38 also contains funds- or value-based terms and applies in the 
context of VAs but is addressed in further detail in sub-section 3.1.8 on International 
Co-operation and the implementation of Recommendations 37 through 40, as 
described in paragraph 8 of INR. 15. 
Licensing or Registration 
123. Countries should designate one or more autho rities that have responsibility for 
licensing and/or registering VASPs. 
124. The FATF Standards allow countries flexibility in applying licensing or registration 
to VASPs. Many countries are confronting the decision of whether to fit VASPs into 
an existing regime for licensing or registration or create a new one. Using an existing 
regime is likely to offer countries a quicker path to implementation and will take 
advantage of existing knowledge in the compliance community of how to operate 
the relevant processes.  Countries may find it is easier to use an existing 
licensing/registration system, such as that for MVTS, to the extent that their existing 
regimes are functional and appropriate for VASPs. However, a new regime could be 
purpose-built for VASPs and not include legacy aspects that may not apply to VASPs. 
For instance, such a regime could include greater focus on technological capacity in 
AML/CFT analysis and the risks and mitigants of the VA sector that differ from the 
traditional financial services sector. It is necessary to confirm in advance that the 
existing system can sufficiently address the risk of VASPs. Where countries have 
created new laws and regulations explicitly for VAs and VASPs, a new 
licensing/registration system may make more sense. Jurisdic tions should base the 
nature and stringency of the requirements and the type of regime they choose on an 
assessment of the different kinds of VA and VASP activity and the associated ML/TF 
risk.  
Which VASPs should be licensed or registered? 
125. In accordance with INR. 15 paragraph 3, at a minimum, VASPs should be required 
to be licensed or registered in the jurisdiction(s) where they are created. References 
to creating a legal person 34 include the incorporation of companies or any other 
mechanism that is used domestically to formalise the existence of a legal entity, such 
as registration in the public register, commercial register, or any equivalent register 
of companies or legal entities; recognition by a notary or any other public officer; 
filing of the company  bylaws or articles of incorporation; allocation of a company 
tax number, etc.  
126. In cases where the VASP is a natural person, it should be required to be licensed or 
registered in the jurisdiction where its place of business is located —the 
                                                      
34  See footnote 40 in INR. 24. 
44  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
determination of which may include several factors for consideration by countries. 
The place of business of a natural person can be characterised by the primary 
location where the business is performed or where the business’ books and records 
are kept as well as where the natural person resides (i.e., where the natural person 
is physically present, located, or resident). When a natural person conducts 
business from his/her residence, or a place of business cannot be identified, his/her 
primary residence may be regarded as h is/her place of business, for example. The 
place of business may also include, as one potential factor for consideration, the 
location of the server of the business. 
127. Jurisdictions may also require VASPs that offer products and/or services to 
customers in, or that conduct operations from, their jurisdiction to be licensed or 
registered in the jurisdiction. Host jurisdictions may therefore require registration 
or licencing of VASPs whose services can be accessed by or are made available to 
people residing or living within their jurisdiction, or may require VASPs that have 
employees or management located in their jurisdiction. While coverage of these 
entities is not required by the FATF Standards, jurisdictions may find it to be useful 
in mitigating risks, part icularly in view of the inherent cross -border availability of 
VAs. When in doubt, jurisdictions may consider that broader coverage is the safer 
course, as VAs will introduce whatever risks they carry with them in any jurisdiction 
in which they are accessib le, regardless of the location in which they are 
incorporated.  
128. In order to identify those VASPs offering products and/or services to customers in 
a jurisdiction without being incorporated in this jurisdiction, supervisors may use a 
set of relevant criteri a. This could include the location of offices and servers 
(including customer -facing operations such as call centres), promotional 
communications targeting specific countries/markets, the language on the VASP 
website and/or mobile application, whether the VASP has a distribution network in 
a country (e.g., if it has appointed an intermediary to seek clients or physically visit 
clients resident in the country), and specific information asked to customers 
revealing the targeted country. 
How to identify VASPs for licensing or registration 
129. Countries should take action to identify natural or legal persons that carry out VA 
activities or operations without the requisite license or registration and apply 
appropriate sanctions, including in the context of traditiona l obliged entities that 
may engage in VA activities or operations ( e.g., a bank that provides VAs to its 
customers). National authorities should have mechanisms to monitor the VASP 
sector as well as other obliged entities that may engage in covered VA acti vities or 
operations or provide covered VA products or services and ensure that appropriate 
channels are in place for informing VASPs and other obliged entities of their 
obligation to register or apply for a license with the relevant authority. Countries 
should also designate an authority responsible for identifying and sanctioning 
unlicensed or unregistered VASPs (as well as other obliged entities that engage in 
VA activities). As discussed in paragraphs 108-109, even countries that choose to 
prohibit VA activities or VASPs in their jurisdiction should have in place tools and 
authorities to identify and take action against natural or legal persons that fail to 
comply with their legal obligations, as required under Recommendation 15.  
 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  45 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
130. In order to identify p ersons operating without a license and/or registration, 
countries should consider the range of tools and resources they may have for 
investigating the presence of an unlicensed or unregistered VASP. For example, 
countries may consider: 
a. blockchain or distributed ledger analytics tools, as well as other investigative 
tools or capabilities; 
b. web-scraping and open -source information to identify any advertising, 
promotional communications or affiliation programs or other possible 
solicitations for business by an unregistered or unlicensed entity;  
c. information from the general public, obliged entities and industry circles 
(including by establishing channels for receiving public feedback) regarding 
the presence of certain businesses that may be unlicensed or unregistered; 
d. FIU or other information from reporting institutions, such as STRs or 
investigative leads that may reveal the presence of an unlicensed or 
unregistered natural or legal person VASP;  
e. non-publically available information, such as whether the entity p reviously 
applied for a license or registration or had its license or registration 
withdrawn; and  
f. law enforcement and intelligence reports , including information from 
international co-operation (e.g., tips from international counterparts). 
Considerations for licensing or registering VASPs 
131. VASPs that are licensed or registered should be required to meet appropriate 
licensing and registration criteria set by relevant authorities. These criteria should 
give national supervisors confidence that the concerned V ASPs will be able to 
comply with their AML/CTF obligations. To that end, the criteria should include the 
obligation to demonstrate that, prior to launch, their AML/CFT programs, including 
policies, procedures and organization taking into account the characteristics of the 
VASP’s activity (i.e., types of VAs and transactions, targeted customers, distribution 
channels), are implemented or able to be implemented once launched. This could 
include judgement as to the competence and trustworthiness of compliance staff. 
The assessment of these criteria is all the more efficient when it is performed in the 
course of the licensing or the registration process and when there is time to ensure 
risk controls are in place prior to launch.   
132. When a jurisdiction establishes  its licencing or registration scheme for VASPs, a 
significant number of VASPs may seek licencing or registration at the same time. To 
enable a smooth process, relevant authorities may consider how to ensure that 
adequate resources are available and sufficient flexibility is built into their approach 
to allow for prioritisation of incoming requests. Countries may consider a range of 
factors in order to prioritize applications, but should rank them based on the 
supervisor’s judgement and capacity.  
133. In the li censing or registration process, competent authorities should take the 
necessary legal or regulatory measures to prevent criminals, or their associates 
from holding, or being the beneficial owner of, a significant or controlling interest, 
or holding a mana gement function in, a VASP. Such measures should include 
requiring VASPs to seek authorities’ prior approval for substantive changes in 
shareholders, business operations, and structures.  
46  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
134. On the basis of risk, authorities may also impose conditions on VASP s seeking a 
license or registration to enable them  to effectively supervise the VASPs. Such 
conditions could potentially include, depending on the size and nature of the VASP 
activities, requiring a resident executive director, substantive management 
presence, specific financial requirements, requirements for VASPs to disclose the 
registration(s) / license(s) which they hold in marketing materials, website and 
mobile applications and/or requirements for VASPs to ensure authorities can 
access data related to the outsourced functions, as well as to the relevant business 
premises of any subcontractors.  
135. Like other entities subject to the FATF Standards, VASPs should put in place 
AML/CFT compliance prior to launch when designing or building a new product or 
service, as it is much more difficult to do so later. Therefore, careful assessment of 
risks and thorough evaluation of mitigation measures at the licensing and 
registration stage is especially important. Once licensing and registration has taken 
place, AML/CFT mitigations which are built into products and services should be 
maintained and be the subject of supervision.  
136. Importantly, jurisdictions may consider emphasizing AML/CFT requirements to 
VASPs through public communication and events (i.e., education campaigns, forums 
or “office hours” with the VA ecosystem). Providing certainty concerning the legal 
framework through advisories or guidance is another key measure to support a 
culture of compliance. Countries may also consider the incentive effect of public ity 
of enforcement actions against unregistered or unlicensed VASPs.  
137. Furthermore, subject to their own discretion, countries may also consider 
designating all VASPs from countries which do not effectively implement licensing 
or registration requirements a s higher risk, so that for a VASP to deal with a 
counterpart in a country without an effective licensing regime is designated high 
risk activity by the supervisor and may incur additional reporting requirements  
(also see the information on EDD in Recommen dation 10 in Section III and on 
counterparty VASP due diligence in Recommendation 16 in Sections III and IV). 
138. All jurisdictions should encourage a culture of compliance with all of a jurisdictions’ 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These may address a range of policy 
objectives, including those related to investor and consumer protection, market 
integrity, prudential requirements, and/or national and economic interests, in 
addition to AML/CFT. To that end, some jurisdictions may decide to underscore this 
by not permitting VASPs to obtain a license from prudential or other authorities 
which is separate from AML/CFT -related authorization. Jurisdictions should also 
ensure that VASPs and authorities devote sufficient resources to their AML/CFT 
compliance functions to cope with expected user and transaction volume.  
139. As previously noted, it is important that ML/TF risks of stablecoins, particularly 
those with potential for mass -adoption and that can be used for P2P transactions, 
are analysed in an ongoi ng and forward-looking manner and are mitigated before 
such arrangements are launched. Where a VASP or other obliged entity is proposing 
to create or use a stablecoin, an assessment of the ML/TF risks and mitigation of the 
risks should form part of the lic ensing or registration process as appropriate. 
Supervisors should be especially cautious of claims that stablecoins involve no 
entity that qualifies as a VASP or other obliged entity. This is especially true in the 
pre-launch phase, as the process of creat ing and developing an asset for launch is 
unlikely to be able to be automated.  The potential for mass -adoption should be 
included as an important factor meriting consideration in the licensing or 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  47 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
registration procedure and risk assessment for all VASPs. As  a general matter, the 
licensing or registration procedure for VASPs and obliged entities launching, or 
involved in, stablecoins should be similar to that for VAs generally. 
Co-operation with domestic and international partners  
140. Co-ordination between various national authorities involved in the regulation and 
licensing or registration of VASPs is important, as described previously in the 
context of Recommendation 2, since various authorities may hold information 
relating to unauthorised providers or activit ies. This is particularly important for 
situations where a country has multiple different licensing or registration schemes 
for VASPs, rather than one central regime.  
141. International co -operation in the registration and licencing process is also 
important. Authorities may also inform their counterparties that VASPs, which they 
have previously registered or licensed, are operating in their counterparties’ 
jurisdictions. Countries should have in place relevant channels for sharing 
information as appropriate to  support the identification and sanctioning of 
unlicensed or unregistered VASPs. Authorities should also consider the Principles 
of Information -Sharing and Co -operation amongst VASP Supervisors for further 
guidance on how to co -operate with counterparts in  the licensing or registration 
process (see Section VI). 
Supervision or Monitoring 
142. Recommendations 26 and 27. As discussed below, Recommendation 15 requires 
countries to subject VASPs to effective systems for AML/CFT supervision or 
monitoring. As set forth  in Recommendations 26 and 27, paragraph 5 of INR. 15 
similarly requires countries to ensure that VASPs are also subject to adequate 
regulation and supervision or monitoring for AML/CFT and are effectively 
implementing the FATF Recommendations, in line wit h their ML/TF risks. VASPs 
should be subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with 
national AML/CFT requirements. VASPs should be supervised or monitored by a 
competent authority, not a self -regulatory body (SRB), which should co nduct risk-
based supervision or monitoring. While SRBs should not be supervisors, SRBs and 
industry groups may assist supervisors in facilitating contact, information -sharing 
and outreach to the VASP sector. Supervisors should have adequate powers to 
supervise or monitor and ensure compliance by VASPs (as well as other obliged 
entities that engage in VA activities) with requirements to combat ML/TF including 
the authority to conduct inspections, access books and records, compel the 
production of information , and impose a range of disciplinary and financial 
sanctions, including the power to withdraw, restrict, or suspend the VASP’s license 
or registration, where applicable. Countries should make clear who their VASP 
supervisors are to their foreign  counterparts for the widest range of international 
co-operation.  
143. Given the cross-border nature of VASPs’ activities and provision of services and the 
potential challenges in associating a particular VASP with a single jurisdiction, 
international co -operation betwee n relevant supervisors is also of specific 
importance, as underlined in paragraph 8 of INR. 15 (see also paragraphs 257-260). 
Jurisdictions could also refer to the relevant work of other international standard -
setting bodies for useful guidance in this res pect, such as the International 
48  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
Organization of Securities Commissions as well as the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision.35 
144. As discussed in more detail in paragraphs 227-228 of this Guidance, when a DNFBP 
engages in VASP activity, countries should subje ct the entity to all of the relevant 
measures for VASPs set forth in the FATF Recommendations, including with respect 
to supervision or monitoring.36  
Preventive Measures 
145. Paragraph 7 of INR. 15 makes clear that all of the preventive measures contained in 
Recommendations 10 through 21 apply to both countries and obliged entities in the 
context of VAs and VA financial activities. However, Recommendations 9, 22, and 23 
also have indirect applicability in this space and are discussed below as well. 
Accordingly, the following sub -section provides a Recommendation -by-
Recommendation explanation to help countries in further considering how to 
implement the preventive measures in the context of VAs. Relatedly, Section IV  
provides guidance specific to VASPs and other o bliged entities that engage in VA 
activities on how they should implement the preventive measures described below 
as well as other AML/CFT measures throughout the FATF Recommendations.  
146. In general, the preventive measures set out in Recommendations 10 to 21 apply to 
VASPs in the same manner as FIs, with two specific qualifications. Firstly, the 
occasional transaction designated threshold above which VASPs are required to 
conduct CDD is USD/EUR 1 000 (rather than USD/EUR 15 000). Secondly, the wire 
transfer rules set out in Recommendation 16 apply to VASPs and VA transfers in a 
modified form (the ‘travel rule’). This is explained in more detail below.  
Financial institution secrecy laws 
147. Recommendation 9 is intended to ensure that financial institution secrecy laws do 
not inhibit the implementation of the FATF Recommendations. As with FIs, 
countries should similarly ensure that secrecy laws do not inhibit the 
implementation of the FATF Recommendations to VASPs, although 
Recommendation 9 does not explicitly include or mention VASPs.  
Customer due diligence  
148. Recommendation 10. Countries and obliged entities should design CDD processes 
to meet the FATF Standards and national legal requirements. The CDD process 
should help VASPs (as well as other obliged entities that engage in VA activities) in 
assessing the ML/TF risks associated with covered VA activities or business 
relationships or occasional transactions above the threshold. Initial CDD comprises 
identifying the customer and, where applicable, the customer’s be neficial owner 
and verifying the customer’s identity on a risk basis and on the basis of reliable and 
independent information, data, or documentation to at least the extent required by 
                                                      
35  See, for example, Principles 3 (on co-operation and collaboration) and 13 (on home-host 
relationships) of the Committee’s Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision : 
www.bis.org/publ/bcbs230.pdf. 
36  Jurisdictions may call or term VASPs as “FIs” or as “DNFBPs.”  However, regardles s of 
what countries may choose to call VASPs, they are still subject to the same level of 
regulation and supervision as FIs, in line with the types of financial activities in which 
VASPs engage and the types of financial services they provide. 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  49 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
the applicable legal or regulatory framework. The CDD process also incl udes 
understanding the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, where 
relevant, and obtaining further information in higher risk situations. 
149. In practice, VASPs can open and maintain accounts ( i.e., establish a customer 
relationship) and should collect the relevant CDD information when they provide 
services to or engage in covered VA activities for or on behalf of their customers. In 
cases where a VASP carries out an occasional transaction, however, the designated 
threshold above which VASPs  are required to conduct CDD is USD/EUR 1 000, in 
accordance with INR. 15, paragraph 7(a).37  
150. Regardless of the nature of the relationship or transaction, countries should ensure 
that VASPs have in place effective procedures to identify and verify, on a risk basis, 
the identity of a customer, including when establishing business relations with that 
customer; where VASPs may have suspicions of ML/TF, regardless of any exemption 
of thresholds; and where they have doubts about the veracity or adequacy of 
previously obtained identification data. 
151. Some jurisdictions may consider the use of VA kiosks (which some may refer to  as 
VA “ATMs,” as described in paragraph  71, on VA services and business models) as 
an occasional transaction, whereby the provider or owner/ope rator of the kiosk 
and the customer using the kiosk transact on a one-off basis. Other jurisdictions may 
not consider such transactions to be occasional, with resulting consequences for 
CDD obligations.  
152. As discussed previously, VAs have certain potential ML/TF risks, including their 
global reach, capacity for rapid settlement, ability to enable P2P transactions, and 
potential for increased anonymity and obfuscation of transaction flows and 
counterparties. In light of these characteristics, countries may therefore go further 
than what Recommendation 10 requires by requiring CDD for VA transfers or 
transactions performed by VASPs (as well as other obliged entities, such as banks 
that engage in VA activities), including “occasional transactions”, at a threshol d 
below the USD/EUR 1 000 threshold, in line with their national legal frameworks. 
Such an approach is consistent with the RBA set out in Recommendation 1, provided 
that it is justified on the basis of the country’s assessment of risks (e.g., through the 
identification of higher risks). Additionally, jurisdictions, in establishing their 
regulatory and supervisory regimes, should consider how the VASP can determine 
and ensure that the transactions are in fact only conducted on a one -off or 
occasional basis r ather than a more consistent ( i.e., non -occasional) basis. In 
determining what approach to take for occasional transactions, countries should 
take into account the product and services provided by VASPs in their jurisdiction. 
Countries may request VASPs to  identify low risk, one -off VA transfers where the 
VASPs are able to accept the residual risk to inform the country’s approach to 
occasional transactions in the VA space.  
153. As described in the Interpretive Note to Recommendation 10  (INR. 10), there are 
circumstances where the ML/TF risk is higher and where enhanced CDD measures 
must be taken. In the context of VA -related activities and VASPs, for example, 
countries should consider country - or geographic -specific risk factors. VASPs 
                                                      
37  The FATF agreed to lower the threshold amount for VA-related transactions to USD/EUR 
1 000, given the ML/TF risks associated with, and cross-border nature of, VA activities.

located in or VA transfers  from or associated with particular countries present 
potentially higher risks for ML/TF (see INR. 10, paragraph 15(b)).  
Enhanced due diligence and simplified CDD 
154. While there is no universally agreed upon definition or methodology for 
determining whether a jurisdiction, in which a VASP operates or from which VA 
transactions may emanate, represents a higher risk for ML/TF, the consideration of 
country-specific risks, in conjunction with other risk factors, provides useful 
information for further determining potential ML/TF risks. Indicators of higher risk 
include:  
a. Countries or geographic areas identified by credible sources 38 as providing 
funding or support for terrorist activities or that have designated terrorist 
organisations operating within them;  
b. Countries identified by credible sources as having significant levels of 
organized crime, corruption, or other criminal activity, including source or 
transit countries for illegal drugs, human trafficking, smuggling, and illegal 
gambling;  
c. Countries that are subject to sanctions, embargoes, or similar measures issued 
by international organisations such as the United Nations; and 
d. Countries identified by credible sources as having weak governance, law 
enforcement, and regulatory regimes, including countries identi fied by the 
FATF statements as having weak AML/CFT regimes, especially for VASPs, and 
for which VASPs and other obliged entities should give special attention to 
business relationships and transactions.  
155. Countries also should consider the risk factors asso ciated with the VA product, 
service, transaction, or delivery channel, including whether the activity involves 
pseudonymous or “anonymous transactions,” “non -face-to-face business 
relationships or transactions,” and/or “payment[s] received from unknown or un-
associated third parties” (see INR. 10 15(c) as well as the examples of higher and 
lower risk indicators listed in paragraph 31 of this Guidance). The fact that nearly 
all VAs include one or more of these features or characteristics may result in 
countries determining that activities in this space are inherently higher risk, based 
on the very nature of VA products, services, transactions, or delivery mechanisms.  
156. In these and other cases, the EDD measures that may mitigate the potentially higher 
risks associated with the aforementioned factors include: 
a. corroborating the identity information received from the customer, such as a 
national identity number, with information in third -party databases or other 
reliable sources;  
b. potentially tracing the customer’s IP address;  
                                                      
38  “Credible sources” refers to information that is produced by reputable and universally 
recognised international organisations and other bodies that make such information 
publicly and widely available.  In addition to the FATF and FATF -style regional bodies, 
such sources may include, but are not limited to, supra -national or international bod ies 
such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Egmont Group of 
Financial Intelligence Units. 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  51 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
c. the use of analysis products, such as blockchain analytics;39 and  
d. searching the Internet for corroborating activity information consistent with 
the customer’s transaction profile, provided that the data collection is in line 
with national privacy legislation.40  
157. Countries also should consider the EDD measures detailed in INR. 10, paragraph 20, 
including obtaining additional information on the customer and intended nature of 
the business relationship, obtaining information on the source of fund s of the 
customer, obtaining information on the reasons for intended or performed 
transactions, and conducting enhanced monitoring of the relationship and 
transactions. Additionally, countries should consider the measures required for FIs 
that engage in fi at-denominated activity that is non -face-to-face (such as mobile 
services) or that is comparable to VA transactions in assessing their risks and 
developing mitigating controls accordingly. 
158. Countries may also encourage their VASPs to collect additional information on high-
risk customers and transactions  in order to  identify, and avoid engaging in, 
prohibited activities, and to enable follow -up actions  in a RBA manner . Such 
additional information may include: 
a. the purpose of transaction or payment; 
b. details about the nature, end use or end user of the item; 
c. proof of funds ownership;  
d. parties to the transaction and the relationship between parties; 
e. sources of wealth and/or funds; 
f. the identity and the beneficial ownership of the counterparty; and 
g. export control information, such as copies of export-control or other licenses 
issued by the national export control authorities, and end-user certification. 
159. Countries should inform VASPs of prohibited activities  through sharing of 
typologies and, where it would support investigation or disruption of the activities, 
on a case -by-case basis  provided that it would not undermine an ongoing 
investigation. If a VASP suspects that a customer is engaged in prohibited activity, 
perhaps unwittingly, they should undertake further CDD measures that do not tip-
off the customer, seek to mitigate risk , take appropriate action including rejecting 
or blocking the transaction when the transaction is identified as prohibited 
activities and file an STR where required. 
Ensuring CDD information is up-to-date 
160. Additionally, countries should require VASPs and other obliged entities that engage 
in or provide VA products and services to keep documents, data, or information 
collected under the CDD process up-to-date and relevant by undertaking reviews of 
existing records, particularly for higher-risk customers or categories of VA products 
                                                      
39  To date, FATF is not aware of any technically proven means of identifying the person that 
manages or owns an unhosted  wallet, precisely an d accurately in all circumstances. 
Countries should be aware of this and also note that the results of the analysis using such 
tools should be considered as reference information only.    
40  See 2015 VC Guidance, paragraph 44 as well as June 2013 Guidance for a Risk -Based 
Approach to New Payment Products and Services, paragraph 66.

or services, and conducting ongoing due diligence (see Section IV for further 
discussion on ongoing due diligence and monitoring obligations for VASPs and 
other obliged entities). Such transactional and record reviews are vital for effective 
supervision and are an important data source for the transfer of the required 
relevant customer information for compliance with the ‘travel rule’ (see 
Recommendation 16). 
Record-keeping  
161. Recommendation 11 requires countries to ensure that VASPs maintain all records 
of transactions and CDD measures for at least five years in such a way that individual 
transactions can be reconstructed and the relevant elements provided swiftly to 
competent authorities. Countries should require VASPs and other obliged entities 
engaging in VA activities to maintain transaction records on transactions and 
information obtained through CDD measures, including: information relating to the 
identification of t he relevant parties, the public keys (or equivalent identifiers), 
addresses or accounts involved (or equivalent identifiers), the nature and date of 
the transaction, and the amount transferred, for example. The public information 
on the blockchain or other  relevant distributed ledger of a particular VA may 
provide a beginning foundation for recordkeeping, provided institutions can 
adequately identify their customers. However, reliance solely on the blockchain or 
other type of distributed ledger underlying t he VA for recordkeeping is not 
sufficient for compliance with Recommendation 11.  
162. For example, the information available on the blockchain or other type of 
distributed ledger may enable relevant authorities to trace transactions back to a 
wallet address, though it may not readily link the wallet address to the name of an 
individual. The wallet address contains a user code that serves as a digital signature 
in the distributed ledger (i.e., a public key) in the form of a unique string of numbers 
and letters. However, additional information will be necessary to associate the 
address to a real or natural person. 
Politically exposed persons  
163. Recommendation 12 requires countries to implement measures requiring obliged 
entities such as VASPs to have appropriate ris k management systems in place to 
determine whether customers or beneficial owners are foreign politically exposed 
persons (PEPs) 41 or related or connected to a foreign PEP and, if so, to take 
additional measures beyond performing normal CDD (as defined in 
Recommendation 10) to determine if and when they are doing business with them, 
including identifying the source of funds when relevant. 
Correspondent banking and other similar relationships 
164. Recommendation 13 stipulates that countries should require FIs to a pply certain 
measures in addition to performing normal CDD measures when they engage in 
cross-border correspondent relationships. INR. 13 stipulates that for 
correspondent banking and other similar cross -border relationships, FIs should 
                                                      
41  “Foreign PEPs” are individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public 
functions by a foreign country, for example Heads of State or of government, senior 
politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state 
owned corporations, and important political party officials (FATF Glossary).  
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  53 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
apply criteria (a) to (e) of Recommendation 13, in addition to performing normal 
CDD measures. “Other similar relationships” includes MVTS when MVTS providers 
act as intermediaries for other MVTS providers or where an MVTS provider 
accesses banking or similar services through the account of another MVTS customer 
of the bank (see 2016 FATF Guidance on Correspondent Banking Relationships).  
165. Recommendation 13 is applicable to VASPs. In this Guidance, a ‘correspondent 
relationship’ is the provision of VASP services by one VASP to  another VASP or FI. 
Like its banking sector equivalent, such a correspondent relationship is 
characterised by its on -going, repetitive nature .42 Such a relationship could also 
include, for example, one VASP white-labelling its platform functionality to another 
VASP and also providing nested services (providing accounts to smaller VASPs for 
access to liquidity and trading pairs). 
166. A correspondent relationship may involve a wide range of services which do not all 
carry the same level of ML/TF risks. To the ext ent that relationships in the VASP 
sector currently have or may in the future have characteristics similar to cross -
border correspondent banking relationships, especially a nested relationship where 
a VASP holds an account at another VASP, countries should  implement the 
preventive measures in Recommendation 13 to VASPs (and other obliged entities 
operating in the VA space) that develop such relationships. Recommendation 13 
includes measures to mitigate the ML/TF risks of cross -border correspondent 
relationships. In applying it to VASPs, countries should require VASPs providing 
services to another VASP or financial institution as part of a cross -border 
correspondent relationship to: 
a. gather sufficient information about the other VASP or FI with which it 
proposes to establish a cross -border correspondent relationship, to 
understand fully the nature of the other VASP or financial institution’s 
business and its AML/CFT risk control framework, including: what types of 
customers the other VASP or FI intends to provi de services to through the 
cross-border correspondent relationship;  
b. gather sufficient information and determine from publicly available sources 
the reputation of the other VASP or FI, the quality of supervision it is subject 
to and whether it has been sub ject to an ML/TF investigation or regulatory 
action; 
c. assess the other VASP’s or FI’s AML/CFT controls; 
d. obtain approval from senior management before establishing new cross -
border correspondent relationships; and 
e. with respect to accounts or custodial wallet s able to be used directly by 
customers of the other VASP or FI to transact business on the customer’s own 
behalf, be satisfied that the other VASP or FI has conducted CDD on such 
customers and is able to provide relevant CDD information on request, to the  
extent permitted privacy and data protection regulations in both jurisdictions.  
167. By applying such measures, a VASP in a cross -border correspondent relationship 
should be able to understand the ML/TF risks and apply appropriate risk -based 
                                                      
42  One-off transactions or the mere messaging rela tionship in the context of non -customer 
relationships, are not correspondent relationships (paragraph 13 of  the FATF Guidance 
on Correspondent Banking). 
54  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
controls. Cross-border correspondent relationships with VASPs in jurisdictions that 
have weak or non-existent AML/CFT regulation or supervision of VASPs will likely 
present higher ML/TF risks. Likewise correspondent relationships that include 
arrangements for providing ser vices which obscure the existence of underlying 
customers and the nature of their transactions, or which involve a significant flow 
of transactions and the execution of third -party payments, will also likely carry 
higher ML/TF risks. In such circumstances,  performing focused transaction 
monitoring with the clear understanding of those underlying customer attributes 
provided by its respondent VASP would be an example of appropriate risk 
mitigation. 
168. While Recommendation 13 does not apply to the domestic equiv alent of  
correspondent relationships, a VASP should undertake risk -based CDD under 
Recommendation 10 on a domestic counterpart VASP when conducting VA 
activities for or on their behalf.  As part of understanding the nature and purposes 
of the business relationship, such due diligence could, on a risk basis, include similar 
consideration of the existence and quality of the counterpart’s AML/CTF controls 
and the services provided to underlying customers through the relationship. The 
principal difference from c ross-border correspondent relationships is that VASPs 
will likely be entitled to assume that other regulated VASPs in the same jurisdiction 
are subject to the same levels of regulation and supervision. Considering the nature 
of VAs and VASPs, countries cou ld recommend that VASPs document how they 
identify their respondent VASP as domestic or cross-border, as it is not as easy as it 
is for banks to identify whether the counterparty of correspondent relationships is 
domestic or cross-border.   
169. For clarity, co unterparty due diligence for the purpose of complying with 
Recommendation 16 is distinct from the obligations applicable to cross -border 
correspondent relationships. Unlike the banking sector, it is possible for transfers 
of VA for or on behalf of another person to occur between VASPs, even in the 
absence of a correspondent relationship or any other relationships. In such 
circumstances, the VASPs involved in the transfer may undertake counterparty due 
diligence to ensure they are able to comply with the travel rule and apply measures 
to mitigate the ML/TF risk. The existence of a correspondent relationship between 
two VASPs involved in a VA transfer may, however, partly or wholly fulfil the 
requirements for counterparty due diligence.  Further information on  how to 
conduct counterparty VASP due diligence in the travel rule context can be found 
under Recommendation 16. 
MVTS 
170. Recommendation 14  directs countries to register or license natural or legal 
persons that provide MVTS in the country and ensure their comp liance with the 
relevant AML/CFT measures. As described in the 2015 VC Guidance, this includes 
subjecting MVTS operating in the country to monitoring for compliance with 
registration or licensing and other applicable AML/CFT measures. The registration 
and licensing requirements of Recommendation 15, however, apply to all VASPs, 
even those engaging in MVTS activities ( e.g., domestic entities that provide as a 
business convertible VA exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies in a 
jurisdiction).  
 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  55 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
171. Recommendation 14 also applies to agents of MVTS providers. That is, any natural 
or legal person conducting MVTS activities on behalf of a VASP, whether by contract 
with or under the direction of the entity. In such arrangements, the agent does not 
provide VASP services to the principal, but instead provides them to third parties 
on behalf of the principal. Entities in the VA sector may frequently act on behalf of 
other entities, depending on the business model. In such a case, a VASP that use 
agents should  be required to include them in their AML/CFT programme and 
monitor them for compliance with their programme. Agents should also be licensed 
or registered by a competent authority, or the principal VASP should be required to 
maintain a current list of its agents accessible by competent authorities in the 
countries in which the principal VASP and its agents operate. 
New technologies  
172. Recommendation 15.  In October 2018, the FATF adopted updates to 
Recommendation 15, which reinforce the fundamental RBA and related obligations 
for countries and obliged entities in the context of new technologies, in order to 
clarify its application in the context of VAs, covered VA financial activities, and 
VASPs. Recommendation 15 requires countries to identify and assess the M L/TF 
risks relating to the development of new products and business practices, including 
new delivery mechanisms, and the use of new or developing technologies for both 
new and pre-existing products. Notably, it also requires countries to ensure that FIs 
licensed by or operating in their jurisdiction take appropriate measures to manage 
and mitigate the associated ML/TF risks before launching new products or business 
practices or using new or developing technologies (see Annex A).  
173. In line with the spirit of  Recommendation 15, the October 2018 update further 
clarifies that countries should manage and mitigate the risks emerging from VAs 
and ensure that VASPs are regulated for AML/CFT purposes, licensed or registered, 
and subject to effective systems for monit oring and ensuring compliance with the 
relevant measures called for in the FATF Recommendations. INR. 15, which the 
FATF adopted in June 2019, further clarifies Recommendation 15 and defines more 
specifically how the FATF requirements apply in relation to VAs, covered VA 
activities, and VASPs, including in the context of: assessing the associated ML/TF 
risks; licensing or registration; supervision or monitoring; preventive measures 
such as CDD, recordkeeping, and suspicious transaction reporting, among othe rs; 
sanctions and other enforcement measures; and international co -operation (see 
Annex A). 
174. In the context of VA and VASP activities, countries should ensure that VASPs 
licensed by or operating in their jurisdiction can manage and mitigate the risks of 
engaging in activities that involve the use of anonymity -enhancing technologies or 
mechanisms, including but not limited to AECs, mixers, tumblers, privacy wallets 
and other technologies that obfuscate the identity of the sender, recipient, holder, 
or beneficial owner of a VA. If the VASP cannot manage and mitigate the risks posed 
by engaging in such activities, then the VASP should not be permitted to engage in 
such activities. 
Wire transfers and the ‘travel rule’ 
175. Recommendation 16 and its Interpretive Note (INR. 16) was developed with the 
objective of preventing terrorists and other criminals from having unfettered access 
to electronically-facilitated funds transfers for moving their funds and for detecting 
56  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
such misuse when it occurs. At the time of drafting, the FATF termed such transfers 
‘wire transfers’. In accordance with the functional approach of the FATF 
Recommendations, the requirements relating to wire transfers and related 
messages under Recommendation 16 apply to all providers of such services . This 
includes VASPs that provide services or engage in activities, such as VA transfers, 
that are functionally analogous to wire transfers.  
Overview of R.16 and its application to VAs and VASPs 
176. Recommendation 16 defines “wire transfers” as any transaction car ried out on 
behalf of an originator through a FI by electronic means with a view to making an 
amount of funds available to a beneficiary person at a beneficiary FI, irrespective of 
whether the originator and the beneficiary are the same person.  
177. Recommendation 16 then establishes the requirements for countries relating to 
wire transfers and related messages and applies to both domestic and cross-border 
wire transfers. In summary, countries should ensure that FIs include required and 
accurate originator info rmation, and required beneficiary information , on wire 
transfers and related messages. FIs should also monitor wire transfers to detect 
those which lack the required originator and/or beneficiary information and screen 
the transactions to comply with relevant UNSCR resolutions (see Recommendations 
6 and 7).  
178. As set out in INR. 15, countries should apply Recommendation 16 to VA transfers 
and VASPs. Countries should apply Recommendation 16 regardless of whether the 
value of the traditional wire transfer or th e VA transfer is denominated in fiat 
currency or a VA. However, recognising the unique technological properties of VAs, 
Recommendation 16 applies in an amended way to VAs as set out in paragraph 7(b) 
of INR.15. The application of the FATF’s wire transfer r equirements in the VA 
context is called the travel rule.   
179. The requirements of Recommendation 16 apply to VASPs whenever their 
transactions, whether in fiat currency or VA, involve: (a) a traditional wire transfer, 
(b) a VA transfer between a VASP and anot her obliged entity ( e.g., between two 
VASPs or between a VASP and another obliged entity, such as a bank or other FI), or 
(c) a VA transfer between a VASP and a non-obliged entity (i.e., an unhosted wallet). 
The full requirements of Recommendation 16 apply to (a) and (b) but not (c), as set 
out below. Countries should treat all VA transfers as cross-border wire transfers, in 
accordance with INR. 1, rather than domestic wire transfers, based on the cross -
border nature of VA activities and VASP operations. Fo r transfers involving 
unhosted wallets (i.e., (c) above), the requirements of R.16 apply in a specific way, 
as explained below.  
180. Transaction fees43 relating to a VA transfer are not within scope of the travel rule. 
Therefore, VASPs do not need to identify t he recipient of the transaction fee, 
because the recipient is not the originator or recipient of the VA transfer itself. There 
may also be scenarios where technical reasons means a VASP must send a greater 
amount of a VA than the actual amount of VA to be transferred, with the difference 
automatically refunded to the ordering VASP. In such a scenario, the travel rule does 
                                                      
43  “Transaction fees” means the amounts of VA that may be collected by the miner who 
includes the transaction in a block. It could be called by various names depending on the 
type of VA, such as gas or block rewards, but they are not within scope of  the travel rule 
for the same reason.  
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  57 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
not apply to the recipient VASP in respect of the refund, as the refund forms part of 
the transfer by the ordering VASP. 
Requirements to obtain, hold and submit required and accurate originator and 
required beneficiary information  
181. Countries should ensure that ordering institutions (whether a VASP or other 
obliged entity such as a FI) involved in a VA transfer, obtain and hold required and 
accurate originator information and required beneficiary information and submit 
the information to beneficiary institutions (whether a VASP or other obliged entity, 
such as a FI), if any. Further, countries should ensure that beneficiary institutions 
(whether a VASP or other obliged entity, such as a FI) obtain and hold required (but 
not necessarily accurate 44) originator information and required and accurate 
beneficiary information, as set forth in INR. 16 (see Box 4 below).

Interpretive Note to Recommendation 16 
6. Information accompanying all qualifying wire transfers should always 
contain: 
(a) the name of the originator; 
(b) the originator account number where such an account is 
used to process the transaction; 
(c) the originator’s address , or national iden tity number, or 
customer identification number, or date and place of birth; 
(d) the name of the beneficiary; and 
(e) the beneficiary account number where such an account is 
used to process the transaction. 
182. For the required information, which the ordering institution must obtain and hold, 
this includes the:  
                                                      
44  As per Figure 1, data accuracy is not required for the beneficiary VASP which receives 
originator information from an ordering VASP. They may assume that the data has been 
verified by the ordering VASP. 
58  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS

a. originator’s name (i.e., the sending person’s accurate (i.e. verified) full name);  
b. originator’s account number where such an account is used to process the 
transaction. In the VA context, this could mean the “wallet address” of the VA;    
c. originator’s physical (geographical) address, or national identity number, or 
customer identification number (i.e., not a transaction number) that uniquely 
identifies the originator to the ordering institution, or date and place of birth. 
For transmitting the geographical address of the originator, that means the 
address which has been verified for accuracy by the originator VASP as part of 
its KYC process (see paragraphs 148-160 on CDD); 
d. beneficiary’s name  (i.e., the n ame of the person who is identified by the 
originator as the receiver of the VA transfer). This is not required to be verified 
by the ordering institution for accuracy, but should be reviewed for the 
purpose of STR monitoring and sanction screening; and  
e. beneficiary account number where such an account is used to process the 
transaction. In the VA context, this could mean the “wallet address” of the VA.    
183. For the required information which the beneficiary institution must obtain from the 
originator institution and hold, this includes the:  
a. originator’s name (i.e., the sending person’s name). The beneficiary institution 
does not need to be verify the originator’s name for accuracy, but should 
review it for the purpose of STR monitoring and sanction screening; 
b. originator’s account number where such an account is used to process the 
transaction. In the VA context, this could mean the “wallet address” of the VA;      
c. originator’s physical (geographical) address, or national identity number, or 
customer identification number (i.e., not a transaction number) that uniquely 
identifies the originator to the ordering institution, or date and place of birth;  
d. beneficiary’s name (i .e., the name of the person who is identified by the 
originator as the receiver of the VA transfer). The beneficiary institution must 
verify the beneficiary’s name for accuracy, if the name of their customer has 
not previously verified. Thus the beneficiary institution can confirm if the 
beneficiary’s name and account number they obtain from the  ordering 
institution match with the beneficiary institution’s verified customer data; and  
e. beneficiary’s account number where such an account is used to process the 
transaction. In the VA context, this could mean the “wallet address” of the VA.

184. VASPs must submit the required information to the beneficiary institution, where 
this exists. It is vital that countries ensure that providers of VA transfers—whether 
VASPs or other obliged entities —transmit the required originator and beneficiary 
information immediately and securely. This is particularly relevant given the rapid 
and cross -border nature of VA transfers and in line with the objectives of 
Recommendation 16 (as well as the traditional requirement in Recommendation 16 
for originator and beneficiary information to “accompany […] wire transfers” 
involving fiat currency). Where there is not a beneficiary institution, the VASP must 
still collect the required information (as set out below).  
185. “Immediately,”— in the context of INR. 15, paragraph 7(b) and given the cross -
border nature, global reach, and transaction speed of VAs —means that providers 
should submit the required information prior, simultaneously or concurrently with 
the transfer itself. See Recommendation 16 in Section IV for additional information 
on these issues specific to VASPs and other obliged entities. 
186. “Securely”, also in the context of I NR. 15, paragraph 7(b), is meant to convey that 
providers should transmit and store the required information in a secure manner. 
This is to protect the integrity and availability of the required information to 
facilitate record -keeping (among other require ments), facilitate the use of such 
information by receiving VASPs or other obliged entities and protect the 
information from unauthorized disclosure. Use of the term is not meant to impede 
the objectives of Recommendation 16 or Recommendation 9 although exceptions or 
altered procedures could be appropriate in cases where a VASP reasonably 
assesses45 that the counterparty VASP cannot sufficiently protect travel rule 
information.  
                                                      
45  VASPs should make a risk -based decision on whom to transact with ( paragraph 199 ).

187. The submission of originator and beneficiary information in batches is acceptabl e, 
as long as submission occurs immediately and securely as per the FATF Standards. 
Post facto  submission of the required information should not be permitted ( i.e., 
submission must occur before or when the VA transfer is conducted).  Countries 
should clarif y that VASPs or other obliged entities should submit the required 
information simultaneously, even if batched, with the VA transfer itself. 
188. It is not necessary for the information to be attached directly to the VA transfer 
itself. The information can be submitted either directly or indirectly, as set forth in 
INR. 15, as long as it is submitted “ immediately and securely ” and available upon 
request to appropriate authorities. Consistent with the FATF’s technology -neutral 
approach, the required information ne ed not be communicated as part of (or 
incorporated into) the transfer on the blockchain or other DLT platform itself. 
Submitting information to the beneficiary VASP could be an entirely distinct process 
from that of the blockchain or other DLT VA transfer.  Any technology or software 
solution is acceptable, provided that the solution enables the ordering and 
beneficiary institutions to comply with the requirements of Recommendation 16 
(and does not, of course, impede their ability to comply with their other AML/CFT 
obligations under the FATF Recommendations). Countries should engage with their 
private sectors on potential applications of available technology or possible 
solutions for compliance with Recommendation 16 (see Section IV for additional 
detail spec ific to providers and other obliged entities in the context of 
Recommendation 16). It is also important to note that co -operation and co -
ordination among regulatory/supervisory authorities , among private sector 
organisations, and between regulatory/supervi sory authorities and private sector 
organisations are crucial to ensure the interoperability of the travel rule solutions 
which VASPs adopt and to achieve the effective implementation of the travel rule 
globally. 
189. For legal persons, the Legal Entity Identif ier (LEI) could be used as additional 
information in payment messages on an optional basis. 46 To allow for the optional 
usage of the LEI, countries may encourage relevant stakeholders (e.g., the Payment 
Market Practice Group in the FIs space, industry assoc iations of VASPs, working 
groups in VASP sector) to work to define a common market practice for whether 
and how to include the LEI in the relevant VA data transfer messages without 
changing the current message structure. 
190. Countries should require both the ordering and beneficiary institution under their 
national frameworks to make the above required information available to 
appropriate authorities upon request, in line with the record-keeping requirements 
set forth in Recommendation 11.  
                                                      
obliged entity, should obtai n the required originator and beneficiary information from 
their user (even when they do not submit the data to beneficiary) ( paragraph 204). 
46  CPMI - Correspondent banking – July 2016. and BCBS - Guidelines Sound management of 
risks related to money laun dering and financing of terrorism(July 2020), “As 
recommended by the CPMI, the use of the LEI as additional information in payment 
messages should be possible on an optional basis in the current relevant payment 
messages ( i.e., MT 202 COV and MT 103). Wher e available, the use of the LEI would 
facilitate the determination by the correspondent bank that the information in the 
message is sufficient to unambiguously identify the originator and beneficiary of a 
transfer”.

191. Countries may choose to adopt a de minimis threshold for VA transfers of USD/EUR 
1 000 in line with the FATF Standards , having regard to the risks associated with 
various VAs and covered VA activities.  If countries choose to implement such a 
threshold, there are comparatively fewer requirements for VA transfers below the 
threshold compared to VA transfers above the threshold. For VA transfers under the 
threshold, countries should require that VASPs collect: 
a. the name of the originator and the beneficiary; and 
b. the VA wallet address for each or a unique transaction reference number.  
192. Such information does not need to be verified unless there are suspicious 
circumstances related to ML/TF, in which case information pertaining to the 
customer should be verified.47 
Sanctions screening for VA transfers 
193. Countries should require both ordering and beneficiary institutions to take freezing 
actions and prohibit transactions with designated persons and entities ( i.e., 
screening and required information relating to VA transfers in order to comply with 
their targeted financial sanctions obligations). The ordering institution should have 
the required information about its customer, the originator, and the beneficiary 
institution should have the required information about its customer, the 
beneficiary, in line with the CDD requirements set forth in Recommendation 10. The 
ordering and beneficiary institutions should have screened their customer ’s name 
for compliance with targeted financial sanctions obligations at the time of 
onboarding their respective (and upon name changes). They must then screen the 
names of the other party (the originator or the beneficiary) when they conduct the 
VA transfer (see Table 1 above).  
194. Countries should require VASPs or other obliged entities to implement an effective 
control framework to ensure that they can comply with their targeted financial 
sanction obligations. This framework should take into account the nature of VA 
transfers. Because the required information identifying the originator and 
beneficiary can be held separately to the VA transfer system ( e.g., the blockchain), 
the VA transfer can be completed even with such information missing or without 
screening the transfer to identify suspicious and prohibited transactions. Therefore, 
VASPs or other obliged entitie s should screen required VA transfer information 
separately to such direct settlement. Thus, VASPs may need to consider mitigation 
measures that fit their business process and the technical nature of VAs. Although 
blockchain technology is ever-changing, examples of controls that a VASP or other 
obliged entity could implement include:  
a. putting a wallet on hold until screening is completed and confirmed that no 
concern is raised; and 
b. arranging to receive a VA transfer with a provider’s wallet that links to a 
customer’s wallet and moving the transferred VA to their customer’s wallet 
only after the screening is completed and has confirmed no concern is raised. 
195. Countries should be aware of this nature of VA transfers, which is different from the 
traditional fiat wire transfer. Thus, countries should require VASPs and other 
obliged entities to document their remediation control action to facilitate effective

supervision. Potentially, countries could ask obliged entities to document this 
control in their AML/CFT risk assessment. 
VA transfers to/from other VASPs and counterparty VASP identification and due 
diligence  
196. FATF expects countries to implement paragraph 7(b) of INR. 15, taking into account 
the unique nature of VA transfers and the future control framework for  travel rule 
solutions in the private sector (see Recommendation 16 in Section IV). A VA transfer 
can be directly settled, i.e. through distributed consensus on the blockchain 
between wallet addresses alone, without the need for an intermediary. For a VASP  
to transmit required information to another VASP however, it is necessary for them 
to identify their counterparty VASP. A VASP would also need to conduct due 
diligence on their counterparty VASP before they transmit the required information 
to avoid dealing with illicit actors or sanctioned actors unknowingly. VASPs do not 
need to undertake the counterparty VASP due diligence process for every individual 
VA transfer when dealing with VASPs for which they have previously conducted 
counterparty due diligence, unless there is a suspicious transaction history or other 
information (such as adverse media, published information about regulatory or 
criminal penalties) indicating they should. Considering the concept of due diligence, 
countries should expect a VASP t o refresh their counterparty due diligence 
information periodically or when risk emerges from the relationship in line with 
their defined RBA control structure. Accordingly, countries should expect their 
obliged VASPs to implement this control mechanism. As already noted, VASPs 
should use this due diligence process to determine whether a counterpart can 
reasonably be expected to protect the confidentiality of information shared with it. 
197. The best way to conduct counterparty due diligence in a timely and secure manner 
is a challenge. 48 There are broadly three phases in this process. These are not 
intended as prescriptive actions that VASPs must take, but guidance on how 
counterparty due diligence could be undertaken:  
a. Phase 1: Determine whether the VA transfer is with a counterparty VASP. A 
person may wish to transfer VAs to another VASP ( e.g., a beneficiary with a 
hosted wallet) or they may wish to transfer VAs to an unhosted wallet. The 
originator VASP must therefore determine whether they will be transacting 
with another VASP. This determination process is not purely an AML/CFT 
requirement, but rather arises from the technology underpinning VAs. To date, 
the FATF is not aware of any technically proven means of identifying the VASP 
that manages the beneficiary wallet exhaustively, precisely, and accurately in 
all circumstances and from the VA address alone; 
b. Phase 2: Identify the counterparty VASP, as a VASP only knows the “name” of 
the counterparty VASP following the previous phase. A VASP may identify a 
counterparty VASP themselves using a reliable database in line with any 
guidelines from a country on when to rely on such data; and 
c. Phase 3: Assess whether the counterparty VASP is an eligible counterparty to 
send customer data to and to have a business relations hip with (see 
Recommendation 16 in Section IV for further information on counterparty

VASP due diligence and Recommendation 11 on record -keeping to 
appropriately store and manage that customer data). 
Figure 1. Overview of generalised counterparty VASP due diligence process 
 
198. To clarify the scope of this Guidance, competent authorities should  require VASPs 
to implement preventive measures in ‘Phase 3’ to assess the counterparty VASP, 
where VASPs first have a business relationship, and then review the results  of the 
due diligence periodically.  Countries should also maintain reliable, independent 
sources of information for ‘Phase 2’ to assist VASPs in their efforts to identify the 
counterparty VASP. This could include regulated institutions lists, such as VASP lists 
where available, registries of beneficial ownership where available and other 
examples mentioned in the BCBS Guideline. 49 For the benefit of effective and 
efficient counterparty due diligence, a regulated institutions list may include but 
should not be limited to contains the VASP name and registered VASP address. 
Considering the increased usage of digitalized processes in the financial industry, 
countries should be encouraged to use a format that is machine-readable. A country 
need not impose a separate licensing or registration system for VASPs with respect 
to natural or legal persons already licensed or registered as FIs (as defined by the 
FATF Recommendations) within that country. Countries that have such frameworks 
may clarify to their private sec tor that such FIs might not be on the designated 
                                                      
49  BCBS (2014, rev. 2020) Sound management of risks  related to money laundering and 
financing of terrorism: revisions to supervisory co-operation, Annex 2” 21. Banks should 
also consider gathering information from public sources. These may include the website 
of the supervisory authority of the respondent bank, for cross -checking identification 
data with the information obtained by the supervisor in the licensing process, or with 
regard to potential AML/CFT administrative sanctions that have been imposed on the 
respondent bank. This may also include public registries (see FATF Guidance, paragraph 
25). www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d505.pdf

VASPs lists, or even not under the supervision of the same regulator, to avoid 
unnecessary de-risking. 
199. In addition, countries should also clarify that VASPs should make a risk -based 
decision on whom to trans act with, acknowledging that the risk mitigating 
measures taken by each individual VASP may vary. In general, those business 
decisions are made by each individual VASP based on their risk-based analysis from 
an AML/CFT perspective, as well as considering other compliance issues, including 
data storage and security, and the profitability of the business relationship . 
Originating entities may wish to require travel rule compliance from their 
beneficiaries, by contract regardless of the lack of regulation in t he beneficiary 
jurisdiction. Subject to their own discretion and ML/TF risk assessment, 
jurisdictions may also consider designating all VASPs from countries which do not 
effectively implement licensing or registration requirements as high-risk. 
200. The FATF ex pects countries to implement paragraph 7(b) of INR.15 as soon as 
possible. Countries may wish to take a staged approach to enforcement of travel 
rule requirements to ensure that their VASPs have sufficient time to implement the 
necessary systems , but shoul d continue to ensure that VASPs have alternative 
measures in place to suitably mitigate the ML/TF risks arising from VA transfers in 
the interim . Countries should also take into account the unique nature of VA 
transfers and the developing control framework for solutions in the private sector 
to securely submit the required information . Nonetheless, countries are 
implementing their AML/CFT frameworks for VASPs at different paces. This means 
that some jurisdictions will require their VASPs to comply with the travel rule prior 
to other jurisdictions ( i.e., the ‘sunrise issue’). This can be a challenge for VASPs 
regarding what approach they should take in dealing with VASPs located in 
jurisdictions where the travel rule is not yet in force . Regardless of the lac k of 
regulation in the beneficiary jurisdiction, originating entities can require travel rule 
compliance from beneficiaries by contract or business practice. In general, those 
business decisions are made by each individual VASP based on their risk -based 
analysis. The level of compliance that a VASP implements with paragraph 7(b) of 
INR. 15 should form part of those decisions. VASPs and FIs should take into account 
the level of ML/TF risk of each individual customer/counterparty VASP and any 
applicable risk mitigation measures implemented by a counterparty/customer 
VASP.  
201.  Given the ‘sunrise issue’ in relation to the travel rule, countries should adopt a RBA 
in the assessment of the business models presented by VASPs. Countries should 
consider the full contex t of travel rule compliance, including whether there are 
sufficient risk mitigation measures taken by the VASP to adequately manage the 
attendant ML/TF risks. Regardless of the regulation in a certain country, a VASP 
may implement robust control measures t o comply with the travel rule 
requirements. Examples include VASPs restricting VA transfers to within their 
customer base (i.e., internal transfers of VAs within the same VASP), only allowing 
confirmed first-party transfers outside of their customer base ( i.e., the originator 
and the beneficiary are confirmed to be the same person) and enhanced monitoring 
of transactions. See Section IV “Counterparty VASP Identification and Due 
Diligence” for more risk remediation examples. While the introduction and 
implementation of relevant regulations by countries is important in itself, the 
absence of relevant regulations in one country does not necessarily preclude the 
effectiveness of measures introduced by a VASP on its own.

VA transfers to/from ‘intermediary VASPs’ 
202. Similar to wire transfers between FIs, there may be VA transfer scenarios that 
involve “intermediary VASPs” or other intermediary obliged entities or FIs that 
facilitate VA transfers as an intermediate element in a chain of VA transfers. 50 
Countries should ensure that such intermediary institutions (whether a VASP or 
other obliged entity) also comply with the requirements of Recommendation 16, as 
set forth in INR. 15, including the treatment of all VA transfers as cross -border 
qualifying transfers. Just as a traditional intermediary FI processing a traditional fiat 
cross-border wire transfer must ensure that all required originator and beneficiary 
information that accompanies a wire transfer is retained with it, so too must an 
intermediary VASP or other comparable intermediary institution that facilitates VA 
transfers ensure that the required information is transmitted along the chain of VA 
transfers, as well as maintaining necessary records and making the information 
available to appropriate authorities upon request. Similarly, where technical 
limitations prevent the required originator or beneficiary information from 
remaining with a required data submission, a record should be kept, for at least five 
years, by the receiving intermediary VASP of all the infor mation received from the 
ordering VASP or another intermediary VASP. Intermediary institutions involved in 
VA transfers also have general obligations to identify suspicious transactions, take 
freezing actions, and prohibit transactions with designated pers ons and entities—
just like ordering and beneficiary VASPs (or other ordering or beneficiary obliged 
entities that facilitate VA transfers). 
VA transfers to/from unhosted wallets 
203. The FATF recognizes that unlike traditional fiat wire transfers, not every VA 
transfer may involve (or be bookended by) two obliged entities, whether a VASP or 
other obliged entity such as a FI. In instances in which a VA transfer involves only 
one obliged entity on either end of the transfer (e.g., when an ordering VASP or other 
obliged entity sends VAs for or on behalf the originator to a beneficiary that is not a 
customer of a beneficiary institution but rather an individual VA user who receives 
the VA transfer to an unhosted wallet), countries should still ensure that the obliged 
entity adheres to the requirements of Recommendation 16 with respect to their 
customer (the originator or the beneficiary, as the case may be).  
204. The FATF does not expect that VASPs and FIs, when originating a VA transfer, to 
submit the required information to individuals who are not obliged entities. VASPs 
sending or receiving a VA transfer to/from an entity that is not a VASP or other 
obliged entity (e.g., from an individual VA user to an unhosted wallet), should obtain 
the required originator and beneficiary information from their customer. Countries 
should require their VASPs or other obliged entities to implement mechanisms to 
ensure effective scrutiny of such transfers , in particular  to meet their STR and 
sanctions implementation obligations (see the d iscussion of Recommendation 20 
below) and, as discussed above, may choose to impose additional limitations  or 
controls on such transfers with unhosted wallets. 
                                                      
50  To clarify, when a VASP, FI or other intermediary obliged entity facilitates a VA transfers 
as an intermediate element in  a chain of VA transfers , and the certain activity/business 
has been classified as a VASP in this Guidance, then they would be classified as an 
“intermediary VASP”. 
66  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
Reliance on third parties  
205. Recommendation 17 allows countries to permit obliged entities to rely  on third 
parties to introduce business and/or perform part of the CDD process, including the 
identification and verification of customers’ identities. The third party, however, 
must be a regulated entity that the competent authorities supervise and monitor for 
AML/CFT, with measures in place for compliance with CDD and record -keeping 
requirements. In addition, reliance on a third party will not relieve the obliged entity 
of its obligations or responsibility in the event of a breach. 
206. Countries may permit VASPs to act as third parties, in accordance with their status 
under Recommendation 15. In addition to checking the regulated status of the third 
party, obliged entities should conduct their selection on a risk basis. In the context 
of third -party VASPs, cou ntries and obliged entities should consider the risks 
potentially posed by the third party, the nature of the business or operation, the 
third-party VASP’s customer groups or target markets, and its business partners, 
where relevant. Where a VASP relies on another VASP for business introduction or 
in the conduct of CDD, the VASP -to-VASP reliance for CDD, particularly in the 
context of VA transfers, should occur in a manner consistent and compliant with the 
requirements of Recommendation 16. 
Internal controls and foreign branches and subsidiaries  
207. Recommendation 18 requires countries to require obliged entities, such as VASPs, 
to have internal controls in place with a view to establishing the effectiveness of the 
AML/CFT policies and processes and the quality of the risk management across its 
operations, departments, branches and subsidiaries, both domestically and, where 
relevant, abroad. Those internal controls should include appropriate governance 
arrangements where responsibility for AML/CFT is clearly all ocated and a 
compliance officer is appointed at management level; controls to monitor the 
integrity of staff, which are implemented in accordance with the applicable local 
legislation; ongoing training of staff; and an (external or internal) independent audit 
function to test the system. 
Higher risk countries 
208. Recommendation 19 requires countries to require obliged entities, such as VASPs, 
to apply EDD measures to business relationships and transactions with natural and 
legal persons from higher risk countri es, which include countries for which EDD 
measures are called for by the FATF. This is of specific relevance for VA activities 
and VASPs, given the cross-border nature of their activities. 
STRs and tipping-off 
209. Recommendation 20 requires all FIs that suspec t or have reasonable grounds to 
suspect that funds are the proceeds of crime or are related to TF to report their 
suspicions promptly to the relevant FIU. Accordingly, countries should ensure that 
VASPs as well as any other obliged entities that engage in covered VA activities file 
STRs (see Section IV for additional information specific to VASPs and other obliged 
entities).  
210. Consistent with paragraph 7 of INR. 15 relating to the application of the preventive 
measures and as discussed above in the context o f Recommendation 16, countries 
also should require VASPs to comply with all of the relevant requirements of 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  67 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
Recommendation 16 in the countries in which they operate (again, see Section IV 
for additional information). 
211. In some jurisdictions that already implement comprehensive AML/CFT obligations 
for VASPs and other obliged entities that engage in VA activities, STRs that reference 
VAs have proven invaluable in furthering law enforcement investigative efforts as 
well as for improving the FIU’s ability to bett er understand and analyse both 
providers and activities in the VA ecosystem. 51 Countries should consider whether 
updates to their existing reporting mechanisms or forms are necessary in order to 
enable providers or other obliged entities to report specific indicators that may be 
associated with VA activity, such as device identifiers, IP addresses with associated 
time stamps, VA wallet addresses, and transaction hashes.  
212. Although VASPs are not required to submit verified required information on the 
beneficiary (see Recommendation 16 above), there could be the situation where a 
VASP has suspicion on the accuracy of data it processes from any discrepancies that 
the VASP has noted. These discrepancies could be identified with the support from 
blockchain analytic tools; information provided by its counterparty VASP; external 
authorities; or based on its transaction history and records. If there are any 
discrepancies due to inaccurate or incomplete information provided by its customer 
(in case of originator VASPs),  or originator VASP s (in case of beneficiary VASPs), 
this should be evaluated together with the transactions requested or related to the 
same customer in order to understand if suspicions arise. Such recognition could be 
highly valuable information for FIU s, LEAs and investigators. Therefore, countries 
should require their VASPs to implement mechanisms to ensure effective scrutiny 
of suspicious transactions  and to meet the requirements of sanctions 
implementation.  
213. Recommendation 21  relates to the tipping -off and confidentiality measures 
applicable to FIs under the FATF Recommendations. Countries should also apply 
such measures to VASPs, as set forth in paragraph 7 of INR. 15 relating to the 
application of the preventive measures. VASPs, their directors, off icers, and 
employees, where applicable, should be protected by law from criminal and civil 
liability for breach of any restriction on disclosure of information and prohibited by 
law from disclosing (or “tipping-off”) STRs, as detailed in Recommendation 21. 
Transparency and Beneficial Ownership of Legal Persons and Arrangements 
214. Recommendations 24 and 25. The FATF Glossary defines VASPs as any natural or 
legal person that conducts as a business the activities or operations specified in the 
VASP definition. Recommendations 24 and 25 explicitly note that countries should 
take measures to prevent the misuse of legal persons and arrangements for ML/TF. 
As with FIs and DNFBPs, countries should therefore take measures to prevent the 
misuse of VASPs and consider measures to facilitate access to beneficial ownership 
                                                      
51  For example, STRs filed both by depository institutions and VASPs (specifically, 
exchangers) enabled U.S. law enforcement to take action in 2017 against BTC -e—an 
Internet-based money transmitter that exchanged fiat currency as well as VAs and 
facilitated transactions involving ransomware, computer hacking, identity theft, tax fraud 
schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking —by helping them to identify VA wallet 
addresses used by BTC -e and detect different illicit streams of activity moving through 
the exchange.

and control information by VASPs undertaking the requirements set out in 
Recommendations 10 and 22. 
Operational and Law Enforcement 
215. Recommendation 29.  STRs filed by VASPs (or other obliged entities such as 
traditional FIs that may be operating in the VA space or engaging in covered VA 
activities) under Recommendation 20 must be filed with the FIU. Additionally, FIUs 
should be able to obtain additional information from reporting entities in their 
jurisdiction, which include VASPs, and should have access on a timely basis to the 
financial, administrative, and law enforcement information that the FIU requires to 
undertake its functions properly.  
216. Readers of this Guidance should note that Recommendation 30 is addressed above 
in the funds - or value -based terms section of the Recommendation -by-
Recommendation analysis. 
217. Recommendation 31.  As with FIs and DNFBPs, countries and competent 
authorities should be able to obtain access to all necessary documents and 
information, including powers to use compulsory measures for the production of 
records, held by VASPs. They should have effective mechanisms in place to identify 
whether natural or legal persons such as VASPs hold or control VA accounts or 
wallets and mechanisms for ensuring that competent authorities have a process to 
identify assets, including VAs, without prior notification to the owner. The 
application of Recommendation 31 is particularly important for countries and their 
competent authorities in addressing and mitigating the ML/TF risks associated with 
covered VA activities and VASPs. 
218. Recommendation 32. Jurisdictions should take a RBA in considering whether to 
apply Recommendation 32 to covered VA activities and VASPs. Specifically, 
jurisdictions should consider in their RBA (a) whether the activities of VASPs and 
with VAs fall under the parameters of transportation of physical monetary 
instruments and (b) how establishing requirements for declaration and systems for 
detection of cross-border movement of such assets would work in practice as well 
as how they would mitigate ML/TF risks in their jurisdiction. 
219. As with Recommendation 30, readers of this Guidance should note that 
Recommendation 33  is addressed above in the funds - or value -based terms 
section. 
220. Recommendation 34 is a vital component in countries’ approaches to identifying 
and addressing the ML/TF risks associated with VA activities and VASPs, as well as 
in relation to the VAs themselves. The relevant competent authorities should 
establish guidelines and provide feedback that will assist VASPs (as well as other 
obliged entities, including traditional FIs) in applying national AML/CFT measures 
and, in particular, in detecting and reporting suspicious transactions —whether 
virtual/fiat or virtual/virtual. 
International Co-operation 
221. Recommendations 36 through 40.  Given the cross-border and mobile nature of 
VA activities and the VASP sector, international co -operation and the 
implementation of Recommendations 36 through 40 by countries and competent 
authorities is critical, particularly the measures applicable to countries and 
competent authorities in Recommendations 37 through 40. Moreover, effective 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  69 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
implementation of the requirements relating to international co -operation is 
important for limiting the ability o f providers’ of VA activities in one jurisdiction 
from having an unfair competitive advantage over providers in other, potentially 
more regulated, jurisdictions and limit jurisdiction shopping or hopping or 
regulatory arbitrage. 
222. Recognizing that effective regulation, supervision, and enforcement relating to the 
VASP sector requires a global approach and a level regulatory framework across 
jurisdictions, paragraph 8 of INR. 15 underscores the importance of the application 
of Recommendations 37 through 40 for  mitigating the risks associated with VAs, 
covered VA activities, and VASPs. Countries should have in place the tools necessary 
to co-operate with one another, provide mutual legal assistance (Recommendation 
37); help identify, freeze, seize, and confiscat e the proceeds and instrumentalities 
of crime that may take the form of VAs as well as other traditional assets associated 
with VASP activities (Recommendation 38); and provide effective extradition 
assistance in the context of VA -related crimes or illicit  actors who engage in illicit 
activities (Recommendation 39), among other international capabilities.  
223. As with other Recommendations that include funds - or value -based terms, 
countries should apply the confiscation and provisional measures relating to 
“property laundered from, proceeds from, instrumentalities used in, or 
instrumentalities intended for use in ML, predicate offences, or TF; or property of 
corresponding value” in the context of VAs.  
224. Paragraph 8 of INR. 15 also specifically requests that supervisors of VASPs exchange 
information promptly and constructively with their foreign counterparts, 
regardless of the supervisors’ nature or status or differences in the n omenclature 
or status of VASPs. 
225. International co -operation is also relevant in the cont ext of VASPs that seek to 
register or license themselves in one jurisdiction but provide products or services 
“offshore” to customers located in other jurisdictions. It is important that FIUs co -
operate and exchange relevant information on relevant STRs wi th their 
counterparts in a timely manner, especially in relation to cross-border VA activities 
or VASP operations. Sufficient oversight and regulatory control of VASPs operating 
in their jurisdiction enables countries to better provide investigatory assistance and 
other international co-operation in the VA space. At present, the lack of regulation 
and investigation capacity in many countries may present obstacles to countries’ 
ability to provide meaningful international co-operation. Moreover, many countries 
do not have legal frameworks that allow them to criminalize certain VA -related 
ML/TF activities, which could further limit their ability to provide effective mutual 
legal assistance in situations where dual criminality is required.  
226. Authorities should al so consider the Principles of Information -Sharing and Co -
operation amongst VASP Supervisors for further guidance on how supervisors can 
co-operate with their counterparts (see Section VI). 
DNFBPs that Engage in or Provide Covered VA Activities 
227. When a DNFBP engages in VASP activity (e.g., when a casino offers VA-based gaming 
or engages in other covered VA activities, products, or services), countries should 
subject the entity to all of the measures for VASPs set forth in the FATF 
Recommendations. Countries should note, for example, that Recommendations 22 
and 23 set out the CDD, recordkeeping, and other requirements for certain types of 
70  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
DNFBPs in the following situations: (a) casinos, (b) real estate agents, (c) dealers in 
precious metals and stones, (d) lawy ers, notaries, other independent legal 
professionals and accountants, and (e) trust and company service providers. 
Recommendation 22 specifically notes that the requirements set out in 
Recommendations 10, 11, 12, 15, and 17 apply to DNFBPs. Thus, in considering how 
to regulate and supervise and apply the preventive measures to DNFBPs that engage 
in VASP activities, countries should refer to the application of Recommendations 10, 
11, 12, 15, and 17, among other Recommendations relevant to VASPs, and apply the 
appropriate CDD, recordkeeping, and other measures accordingly. Countries should 
also ensure that DNFBPs engaging in VASP activities are registered/licensed in 
relation to those VASP activities (see paragraphs 123-139). 
228. Similarly, Recommendation 28 requi res countries and competent authorities to 
subject DNFBPs to regulatory and supervisory measures, as set out in the FATF 
Recommendations. As stated previously, countries should subject VASPs, including 
DNFBPs that engage in VASP activities, to a level of s upervision and regulation on 
par with FIs and not to DNFBP -level supervision. Where a DNFBP engages in 
covered VASP activities ( e.g., a casino that provides VA products and services or 
engages in covered VA activities), countries should subject the DNFBP t o a higher 
level of supervision ( e.g., “DNFBP plus” supervision), consistent with the higher 
level of supervision for all VASPs, which is equivalent to the level of supervision and 
regulation for FIs as laid out in Recommendations 26 and 27. In such instances, the 
entity is, in essence, a VASP engaging in specified financial activities and not a 
DNFBP, regardless of what a country may term, call, or label such an entity, 
institution, or product or service provider. This approach by countries will help to 
ensure a level regulatory playing field across the VASP sector globally and a level of 
supervision for VASPs that is consistent with and appropriate for the types of 
activities in which they engage. See Section I above for further information as to who 
a VASP is.  
Risk-Based Approach to Supervision or Monitoring of VASPs 
Understanding the ML/TF Risks 
229. The RBA to AML/CFT aims to identify, understand, and assess ML/TF risks  and 
develop prevention or mitigation measures that are commensurate with the ML/TF 
risks that countries and the relevant obliged entities identify. In the case of 
supervision, the RBA applies to the way in which supervisory authorities allocate 
their resources. It also applies to supervisors discharging their functions in a way 
that is conducive to the application of the RBA by VASPs.  
230. In March 2021, the FATF released Guidance for supervisors on the risk -based 
approach to AML/CFT supervision. This document sets out guidance for supervisors 
to assist them in undertaking risk -based supervision broadly. It also includes 
additional guidance and practical advice for VASP supervisors specifically. This 
document should be read in conjunction with this Guidance here. 
231. An effective risk -based regime should reflect a country’s policy, legal, and 
regulatory approach. The national policy, legal, and regulatory framework should 
also reflect the broader context of financial sector policy objectives that the country 
is pursuing, including financial inclusion, financial stability, financial integrity, and 
financial consumer protection goals, and consider such factors as market 
competition. The extent to which the national framework allows VASPs to apply a 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  71 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
RBA should also reflect the nature, diversity, and maturity of the VASP sector and 
its risk profile as well as the ML/TF risk associated with individual VASPs and 
specific VA products, services, or activities. 
232. Supervisors should also develop a deep understanding of t he VASP market, its 
structure, and its role in the financial system and the country’s economy to better 
inform their assessment of risk in the sector. This may require investing in training, 
personnel, or other resources that enable supervisors to gain the practical skillsets 
and expertise needed to regulate and supervise the range of VA providers and 
activities described in the VA services or business models at the onset of this 
Guidance. 
233. Supervisors should draw on a variety of sources to identify and asse ss the ML/TF 
risks associated with VA products, services, and activities as well as with VASPs. 
Such sources should include, but are not limited to, the jurisdiction’s national or 
sectoral risk assessments, domestic or international typologies and supervis ory 
expertise, and FIU guidance and feedback. Where competent authorities do not 
adequately understand the VASP sector or broader VA ecosystem in the country, it 
may be appropriate for competent authorities to undertake a more targeted 
sectoral risk assessment in relation to the VASP sector and/or VA environment in 
order to develop a national-level understanding of the relevant ML/TF risks and to 
inform the institutional assessments that should be undertaken by VASPs. 
234. A number of jurisdictions are using, or  exploring using, blockchain analytics 
services to assist with their supervision. The services can be used in a number of 
ways, including to pinpoint areas that supervisors may wish to focus on during 
assessments of individual VASPs and helping to categori se the highest risk VASPs 
based on their activity. There is a cost consideration with these tools and not all VAs 
are covered by all vendors. Blockchain analytics are also widely used by VASPs and 
some FIs to monitor their own exposure to risk (e.g., VA transfers that have passed 
through mixer services  or come from privacy wallets ). It is important to consider 
any potential implications for privacy and data protection in the use of such tools, if 
they allow transparency that is not otherwise available (e.g., on public blockchains).  
235. Access to information about ML/TF risks is fundamental for an effective RBA. 
Recommendation 1 (see INR. 1.3) requires countries, including supervisors, to take 
appropriate steps to identify and assess ML/TF risks for the country on an ongoing 
basis in order to make information available for AML/CFT risk assessments 
conducted by FIs and DNFBPs, including VASPs. Countries, including supervisors, 
should keep the risk assessments up -to-date and should have mechanisms to 
provide approp riate information on the results to all relevant competent 
authorities, FIs, and DNFBPs, including VASPs. In situations where some parts of the 
VASP sector have potentially limited capacity to identify the ML/TF risks associated 
with VA products, services,  or activities, countries, including supervisors, should 
work with the sector to understand its risks and to help the private sector in 
developing its own understanding of the risks. Depending on the capacity of the 
VASP sector, general information or more granular information and support may be 
required. 
236. In considering individual VASPs or particular VA products, services, or activities, 
supervisors should take into account the level of risk associated with the VASPs’ 
products and services, business models,  corporate governance arrangements, 
financial and accounting information, delivery channels, customer profiles, 
geographic location, countries of operation, VASPs’ level of compliance with 
72  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
AML/CFT measures, as well as the risks associated with specific VA tokens or 
products that potentially obfuscate transactions or undermine the ability of VASPs 
and supervisors to implement effective AML/CFT measures. Supervisors should 
also look at the controls in place in a VASP, including the quality of a VASP’s risk 
management policy or the functioning of its internal oversight mechanisms. Other 
information that may be relevant in the AML/CFT context includes the fitness and 
propriety of the VASP’s management and compliance functions. 
237. Some of the aforementioned informat ion can be obtained through prudential 
supervisors in countries where VASPs or other obliged entities that engage in 
covered VA activities are subject to prudential regulations ( i.e., where VASPs are 
traditional FIs subject to the Core Principles,52 such as banks, insurance companies, 
securities providers, or investment companies), which therefore involves 
appropriate information sharing and collaboration between prudential and 
AML/CFT supervisors, especially when the responsibilities belong to separate 
agencies. In other regulatory models, such as those that focus on licensing or 
registration of VASPs at the national level but have shared oversight and 
enforcement at the state level, information sharing should include the sharing of 
examination findings. 
238. Where relevant, information from other stakeholders, such as supervisors 
(including overseas supervisors and supervisors of payment systems and 
instruments as well as securities, commodities and derivatives thereof), the FIU and 
law enforcement agencies may a lso be helpful for supervisors in determining the 
extent to which a VASP effectively manages the ML/TF risks to which it is exposed. 
Some regimes, such as those that only require registration (without extensive 
background testing) may still enable law enfo rcement and regulators to be aware 
of the existence of a VASP, its lines of business, its particular VA products or services, 
and/or its controlling interests.  
239. Supervisors should review their assessment of the risk profiles of both the VASP 
sector and VASPs periodically and when VASPs’ circumstances change materially or 
relevant new threats emerge. Examples of existing country supervisory practices 
for VASPs or the broader VASP sector as well as country examples relating to ML/TF 
risks associated with part icular VA products, services, or business models can be 
found in Section V of this Guidance. 
Mitigating the ML/TF Risks 
240. The FATF Recommendations require supervisors to allocate and prioritize more 
supervisory resources to areas of higher ML/TF risk. This m eans that supervisors 
should determine the frequency and intensity of periodic assessments based on the 
level of ML/TF risks to which the sector and individual VASPs are exposed. 
Supervisors should give priority to the potential areas of higher risk, eithe r within 
the individual VASP (e.g., to the particular products, services, or business lines that 
a VASP may offer, such as particular VAs or VA services like AECs or mixers and 
tumblers that may further obfuscate transactions or undermine the VASP’s abilit y 
                                                      
52  Under the FATF Recommendations, “core principles” refers to the Core Princ iples for 
Effective Banking Supervision issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 
the Objectives and Principles for Securities Regulated issued by the International 
Organization of Securities Commissions, and the Insurance Supervisory Principles issued 
by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.  
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  73

to implement CDD measures) or to particular types of VASPs ( e.g., to VASPs that 
only or predominantly facilitate virtual -to-virtual financial activities or that offer 
particular VA obfuscating products or services, or VASPs that facilitate VA transfers 
for or on behalf of a person to individual users that are not users of another 
regulated entity, such as a beneficiary institution), or VASPs operating from or in 
higher-risk jurisdictions. If a jurisdiction chooses to classify an entire sector as 
higher ri sk, countries should still understand and be able to provide some 
explanation and granularity on the categorisation of individual VASPs within the 
sector based on their customer base, the countries they deal with, and their 
applicable AML/CFT controls. 
241. It is also important that competent authorities acknowledge that in a risk -based 
regime, not all VASPs will adopt identical AML/CFT controls and that single, 
unwitting and isolated incidents involving the transfer or exchange of illicit 
proceeds do not necessarily invalidate the integrity of a VASP’s AML/CFT controls. 
On the other hand, VASPs should understand that a flexible RBA does not exempt 
them from applying effective AML/CFT controls. 
242. Examples of ways in which supervisors can adjust their approach include: 
a. Adjusting the type of AML/CFT supervision or monitoring : supervisors should 
employ both offsite and onsite access to all relevant risk and compliance 
information. However, to the extent permitted by their regime, supervisors 
can determine the correct mix of offsite and onsite supervision or monitoring 
of VASPs. Offsite supervision alone may not be appropriate in higher risk 
situations. However, where supervisory findings in previous examinations 
(either offsite or onsite) suggest a low risk for ML/TF, r esources can be 
allocated to focus on higher risk VASPs. In that case, lower risk VASPs could be 
supervised offsite, for example through transaction analysis and 
questionnaires. 
b. Adjusting the frequency and nature of ongoing AML/CFT supervision or 
monitoring: supervisors should adjust the frequency of AML/CFT 
examinations in line with the risks identified and combine periodic reviews 
and ad hoc AML/CFT supervision as issues emerge (e.g., as a result of credible 
whistleblowing, information from law enforcemen t, analysis of financial 
reporting or other supervisory findings). Other RBAs to supervision could 
include consideration of the geographic location, registration or licensing 
status, customer base, transaction type ( e.g., virtual/fiat or virtual/virtual 
transactions), VA type, number of accounts or wallets, revenue, products or 
services offered ( e.g., more transparent services versus those products or 
services that obfuscate transactions, such as AECs), prior history of non -
compliance, and/or significant changes in management. 
c. Adjusting the intensity of AML/CFT supervision or monitoring and reporting 
requirements: supervisors should decide on the appropriate scope or level of 
assessment in line with the risks identified, with the aim of assessing the 
adequacy of VASPs’ policies and procedures that are designed to prevent 
VASPs’ abuse. Examples of more intensive supervision could include detailed 
testing of systems and files to verify the implementation and adequacy of the 
VASPs’ risk assessment, reporting and record-keeping policies and processes, 
internal auditing, interviews with operation staff, senior management and the 
Board of Directors, where applicable. 
243. Supervisors should use their findings to review and update their ML/TF risk 
assessments and, where n ecessary, consider whether their approach to AML/CFT 
74  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
supervision and AML/CFT rules and guidance remains adequate. Whenever 
appropriate, and in compliance with any relevant standards or requirements 
relating to the confidentiality of such information, supervisors should communicate 
their findings to VASPs to enable them to enhance the quality of their RBA. 
General Approach 
244. Supervisors should understand the ML/TF risks faced by VASPs or associated with 
the VASP sector. Supervisors should have a comprehensive understanding of higher 
and lower risk lines of business or particular VA products, services or activities, with 
a particularly thorough understanding of the higher -risk products, services or 
activities. 
245. Supervisors should ensure that their staff is trained and equipped to assess whether 
a VASP’s policies, procedures, and controls are appropriate and proportional in 
view of the VASP’s risk assessment and risk management procedures. To support 
supervisors’ understanding of the overall strength of measures in  the VASP sector, 
countries could consider conducting a comparative analysis of VASPs’ AML/CFT 
programs in order to further inform their judgment of the quality of an individual 
VASP’s controls.  
246. In the context of the RBA, supervisors should determine whether a VASP’s AML/CFT 
compliance and risk management program is adequate to (i) meet the regulatory 
requirements, and (ii) appropriately and effectively mitigate and manage the 
relevant risks. In doing so, supervisors should take into account the VASP’s own risk 
assessment. In the case of VASPs that operate across different jurisdictions on the 
basis of multiple licenses or registrations, given the cross-border nature of covered 
VA activities, the supervisor that licenses or registers the natural or legal pe rson 
VASP should take into consideration the risks to which the VASP is exposed and the 
extent to which those risks are adequately mitigated. 
247. As part of their examination procedures, supervisors should communicate their 
findings and views about an individual VASP’s AML/CFT controls and communicate 
clearly their expectations of the measures needed for VASPs to comply with the 
applicable legal and regulatory frameworks. In jurisdictions where VA financial 
activities may implicate multiple competent authoritie s, supervisory counterparts 
within the jurisdiction should also co-ordinate with one another, where applicable, 
to effectively and clearly communicate their expectations to VASPs as well as to 
other obliged entities that may engage in VA activities or prov ide VA products or 
services. This is particularly important in the context of VASPs that engage in 
various types of regulated VA activity ( e.g., VA money or value transfer services or 
securities, commodities or derivatives activity) or in VA financial activities that may 
implicate various banking, securities, commodities, or other regulators. 
248. Where AML/CFT weaknesses are identified in VASPs, supervisors should follow-up 
and assess the robustness of remediation actions taken to rectify the deficiencies, 
and to prevent recurrence. For regulatory breaches, supervisors should have a 
broad range of regulatory/supervisory measures available that can be applied to 
address the risks exposed by the lack of compliance. This range could include 
warnings, action letters , orders, agreements, administrative sanctions, penalties 
and fines and other restrictions and conditions on a VASP’s activities. A full range of 
measures should be applied taking into account the level of severity of the identified 
breaches in the context  of unmitigated risks. Priority should be given to those 
deficiencies that expose the system to the greatest ML/TF risks. For further 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  75 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
guidance on applying dissuasive, proportionate and effective sanctions, see the 
FATF’s Guidance on Effective Supervision and Enforcement by AML/CFT 
Supervisors of the Financial Sector and Law Enforcement. 
249. VASPs or FIs involved in stablecoins  should be supervised in the same manner as 
VAs or financial assets as appropriate. Like other VAs, assessment of their risks 
should form part of this process, and stablecoins may pose higher or lower ML/TF 
risks, according to the judgement of supervisors, with attendant cons equences for 
the type and intensity of supervision. If a given stablecoin qualifies as a financial 
asset, it should be supervised according to that determination in the same manner 
as all other similarly categorized assets. Given the cross -border nature of  VA 
transfers, international co-operation of VASP supervisors is very important  in this 
context.   
Guidance 
250. Supervisors should communicate their expectations of VASPs’ compliance with 
their legal and regulatory obligations and may consider engaging in a co nsultative 
process, where appropriate, with relevant stakeholders. Such guidance may be in 
the form of high -level requirements based on desired outcomes, risk -based 
obligations, and information about how supervisors interpret relevant legislation 
or regula tion or more detailed guidance about how VASPs might best apply 
particular AML/CFT controls. 
251. Supervisors and other competent authorities may consider the guidance and input 
of VA technical experts in order to develop a deeper understanding of the relevant 
business models and operations of VASPs, their potential exposure to ML/TF risks, 
as well as the ML/TF risks associated with particular VA types or specific covered 
VA activities and to make an informed judgment about the mitigation measures in 
place or needed. 
252. As discussed previously, providing guidance for and feedback to the VASP sector is 
essential and is a requirement under Recommendation 34. The guidance could 
include best practices that enable VASPs to undertake assessments and develop risk 
mitigation and compliance management systems to meet their legal and regulatory 
obligations. Supporting ongoing and effective communication between supervisors 
and VASPs is an essential component of the successful implementation of a RBA. 
253. Supervisors of VASPs shoul d also consider liaising with other relevant domestic 
regulatory and supervisory authorities to secure a coherent interpretation of 
VASPs’ legal obligations and to promote a level playing field, including between 
VASPs and between VASPs and other obliged entities such as FIs and DNFBPs. Such 
co-ordination is particularly important where more than one supervisor is 
responsible for supervision (e.g., where the prudential supervisor and the AML/CFT 
supervisors are in different agencies or in separate divisions of the same agency). It 
also is particularly relevant in the context of VASPs that provide various products 
or services or engage in different financial activities that may fall under the purview 
of different regulatory or supervisory authorities within a  particular jurisdiction. 
Multiple sources of guidance should not create opportunities for regulatory 
arbitrage, loopholes, or unnecessary confusion among VASPs. When possible, 
relevant regulatory and supervisory authorities in a jurisdiction should consid er 
preparing joint guidance. 
76  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
Training 
254. Training, at all levels, from front-line supervisors to managers and board members, 
is important for supervision staff to understand the VASP sector and the various 
business models that exist. In particular, supervisor s should ensure that staff are 
trained to assess the quality of a VASP’s ML/TF risk assessment and to consider the 
adequacy, proportionality, effectiveness, and efficiency of the VASP’s AML/CFT 
policies, procedures, and internal controls in light of its ri sk assessment. Training 
on current and emerging technologies such  as blockchain or other analytics may 
also be useful.  
255. Training should cover issues such as how to interact with entities and allow 
supervisory staff to form sound judgements about the qualit y of the VASP’s risk 
assessments and the adequacy and proportionality of a VASP’s AML/CFT controls. 
It should also aim at achieving consistency in the supervisory approach at a national 
level in cases where there are multiple competent supervisory authorities or when 
the national supervisory model is devolved or fragmented. 
256. Similarly, countries should consider opportunities for public-private sector training 
and collaboration to further educate and raise awareness among both operational 
and other competent authorities and industry on various issues relating to VAs and 
VASP activities.  
Information Exchange 
257. Information exchange between the public and private sector is important and 
should form an integral part of a country’s strategy for combating ML/TF in th e 
context of VA and VASP activities. Public authorities should share risk information, 
where possible, to better help inform the risk assessments of VASPs. The type of 
information relating to risks in the VA space that the public and private sectors 
could share include: 
a. ML/TF risk assessments; 
b. Typologies and methodologies of how money launderers or terrorist 
financiers misuse VASPs, a particular VA mechanism over another ( e.g., VA 
transfer or exchange activities versus VA issuance activities in the context of 
money laundering or terrorist financing) or VAs more generally; 
c. General feedback on the quality and usefulness of STRs and other relevant 
reports; 
d. Information on suspicious indicators associated with VA activities or VASP 
transactions; 
e. Targeted unclassi fied intelligence, where appropriate and subject to the 
relevant safeguards such as confidentiality agreements; and  
f. Countries, persons, or organisations whose assets or transactions should be 
frozen pursuant to targeted financial sanctions as required by 
Recommendation 6. 
258. Further, countries should consider how they might share information with the 
private sector in order to help the private sector, including VASPs, better 
understand the nature of law enforcement information requests or other 
government requests for information or to help shape the nature of the requests so 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  77 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
that VASPs can provide more accurate and specific information, where applicable, 
to competent authorities.  
259. Domestic co-operation and information exchange between the supervisors of the 
banking, securities, commodities, and derivatives sectors and the VASP sector; 
among law enforcement, intelligence, FIU and VASP supervisors; and between the 
FIU and the supervisor(s) of the VASP sector are also of vital importance for 
effective monitoring and supervision of VASPs.  
260. Similarly, in line with Recommendation 40, cross -border information sharing by 
authorities and the private sector with their international counterparts is critical in 
the VASP sector, taking into account the cross -border nature a nd multi -
jurisdictional reach of VASPs. Authorities should also consider the Principles of 
Information-Sharing and Co -operation amongst VASP Supervisors for further 
guidance on how to co-operate with their counterparts (see Section VI).

PART FOUR: 
APPLICATION OF FATF STANDARDS TO VASPs AND OTHER OBLIGED 
ENTITIES THAT ENAGE IN OR PROVIDE COVERED VA ACTIVITIES 
261. The FATF Recommendations apply both to countries as well as to VASPs and other 
obliged entities that provide covered VA -related services or financial  activities or 
operations (“other obliged entities”), including banks, securities broker -dealers, 
and other FIs. Accordingly, Section IV provides additional guidance specific to 
VASPs and other obliged entities that may engage in covered VA activities.  
262. In addition to identifying, assessing, and taking effective action to mitigate their 
ML/TF risks, as described under Recommendation 1 , VASPs and other obliged 
entities in particular should apply all of the preventive measures in 
Recommendations 9 through 21 as set forth above in Section III, including in the 
context of CDD, when engaging in any covered VA activities. Similarly, DNFBPs 
should be aware of their AML/CFT obligations when engaging in covered VA 
activities as set forth in INR. 15 and as described in paragraphs 227-228  
263. Readers of this Guidance should note that the below paragraphs relating to 
individual preventive measures and FATF Recommendations are intended to 
provide additional specific guidance for VASPs and other obliged entities on certain 
issues. The lack of a dedicated paragraph for each FATF Recommendation within 
the preventive measures, as provided in Section III, for example, does not mean that 
the respective Recommendations or preventive measures contained therein do not 
also apply to VA SPs and other obliged entities that engage in or provide VA 
activities.    
264. In general, the preventive measures set out in Recommendation 9 to 21 apply to 
VASPs in the same manner as FIs, with two specific qualifications. Firstly, the 
occasional transaction  designated threshold above which VASPs are required to 
conduct CDD is USD/EUR 1 000 (rather than USD/EUR 15 000). Secondly, the wire 
transfer rules set out in Recommendation 16 apply to VASPs and VA transfers in a 
modified form (the ‘travel rule’). This is explained in more detail below.  
Customer due diligence  
265. Recommendation 10  sets forth the required CDD measures that FIs must 
implement for all customers, including identifying the customer and verifying the 
customer’s identity using reliable, independen t source documents, data or 
information; identifying the beneficial owner; understanding and obtaining 
information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship; and 
conducting ongoing due diligence on the relationship and scrutiny of transactions.

When to conduct CDD 
266. Recommendation 10 also describes the scenarios under which FIs must undertake 
CDD measures, including in the context of establishing business relations, carrying 
out occasional transactions above the designated threshold (USD/EUR 1 000 for VA 
transactions), carrying out occasional transactions that are wire transfers as set 
forth under Recommendation 16 and its Interpretive Note (also USD/EUR 1 000 for 
VA transfers), where there is a suspicion of ML/TF, or when the FI doubts the 
veracity or adequacy of previously obtained customer identification data. While 
countries may adopt a de minimis threshold of USD/EUR 1 000 under their national 
framework for VA transactions that they deem are occasional (as described in 
Section III) o r for VA transfers, all of which are treated as cross -border qualifying 
wire transfers for the purposes of applying Recommendation 16, it should be 
underscored that banks, broker -dealers, and other FIs must still adhere to their 
respective CDD thresholds w hen engaging in covered VA activities. For DNFBPs, 
such as casinos, that engage in covered VA activity, they should apply the de minimis 
threshold of USD/EUR 1 000 for occasional transactions and for occasional 
transactions that are wire transfers as descr ibed in Section III and as discussed 
below. As noted in Section III in the context of countries, VASPs, in establishing their 
operating procedures and processes when accepting customers and facilitating 
transactions, should consider how they can determine and ensure that transactions 
are in fact only conducted on a one -off or occasional basis rather than on a more 
consistent (i.e., non-occasional) basis. 
267. Although the designated thresholds above which casinos and dealers in precious 
metals and stones must conduct CDD for occasional transactions and for occasional 
transactions that are wire transfers are USD/EUR 3 000 and USD/EUR 15 000 
respectively, when DNFBPs engage in any covered VA or VASP activities, they are 
subject to the CDD standards as set forth under INR. 15 (i.e., a de minimis threshold 
of USD/EUR 1 000 for occasional transactions and for occasional transactions that 
are wire transfers). 
How to conduct CDD 
268. Regardless of the nature of the relationship or VA transaction, VASPs and other 
obliged entit ies should have in place CDD procedures that they effectively 
implement and use to identify and verify on a risk basis the identity of a customer, 
including when establishing business relations with that customer; where they have 
suspicions of ML/TF, regar dless of any exemption of thresholds; and where they 
have doubts about the veracity or adequacy of previously obtained identification 
data.  
269. Like other obliged entities, in conducting CDD to fulfil their obligations under 
Recommendation 10, VASPs should ob tain and verify the customer 
identification/verification information required under national law. Typically, 
required customer identification information includes information on the 
customer’s name and further identifiers such as physical address, date of birth, and 
a unique national identifier number ( e.g., national identity number or passport 
number). Depending upon the requirements of their national legal frameworks, 
VASPs are also encouraged to collect additional information to assist them in 
verifying the customer’s identity when establishing the business relationship ( i.e., 
at onboarding); authenticate the identity of customers for account access; help 
determine the customer’s business and risk profile and conduct ongoing due 
80  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
diligence on the business relationship; and mitigate the ML/TF risks associated with 
the customer and the customer’s financial activities. Such additional, non -core 
identity information, which some VASPs currently collect, could include, for 
example an IP address with an associated  time stamp; geo -location data; device 
identifiers; VA wallet addresses; and transaction hashes.  
270. For covered VA activities, the verification of customer and beneficial ownership 
information by VASPs should be completed before or during the course of 
establishing the relationship.53  
271. Where a VASP cannot apply the appropriate level of CDD, Recommendation 10 
requires the VASP to not enter into a business relationship or carry out an 
occasional transaction or to terminate an already -existing business relationsh ip; 
and consider making a STR in relation to the customer. 
272. Based on a holistic view of the information obtained in the context of their 
application of CDD measures —which could include both traditional information 
and non -traditional information as describe d above —VASPs and other obliged 
entities should be able to prepare a customer risk profile in appropriate cases. A 
customer’s profile will determine the level and type of ongoing monitoring 
potentially necessary and support the VASP’s decision whether to e nter into, 
continue, or terminate the business relationship. Risk profiles can apply at the 
customer level ( e.g., nature and volume of trading activity, origin of virtual funds 
deposited, etc.) or at the cluster level, where a cluster of customers displays  
homogenous characteristics ( e.g., clients conducting similar types of VA 
transactions or involving the same VA). VASPs should periodically update customer 
risk profiles of business relationships in order to apply the appropriate level of CDD.  
273. If a VASP u ncovers VA addresses that it has decided not to establish or continue 
business relations with or transact with due to suspicions of ML/TF, the VASP 
should consider making available its list of “blacklisted wallet addresses,” subject to 
the laws of the VASP ’s jurisdiction. A VASP should screen its customer’s and 
counterparty’s wallet addresses against such available blacklisted wallet addresses 
as part of its ongoing monitoring. A VASP should make its own risk -based 
assessment and determine whether additional mitigating or preventive actions are 
warranted if there is a positive hit. 
274. VASPs and other obliged entities that engage in covered VA activities may adjust the 
extent of CDD measures, to the extent permitted or required by their national 
regulatory requirements, in line with the ML/TF risks associated with the individual 
business relationships, products or services, and VA activities, as discussed above 
under the application of Recommendation 1. VASPs and other obliged entities must 
therefore increase the  amount or type of information obtained or the extent to 
which they verify such information where the risks associated with the business 
relationship or VA activities is higher, as described in Section III. Similarly, VASPs 
and other obliged entities may also simplify the extent of the CDD measures where 
the risk associated with the business relationship of activities is lower. However, 
VASPs and other obliged entities may not apply simplified CDD or an exemption 
from the other preventive measures simply on  the basis that natural or legal 
persons carry out the VA activities or services on an occasional or very limited basis 
(INR. 1.6(b)). Further, simplified CDD measures are not acceptable whenever there

is a suspicion of ML/TF or where specific higher -risk scenarios apply (see Section 
III for an explanation of potentially higher-risk situations) 
Ongoing CDD and monitoring  
275. Ongoing monitoring on a risk basis means scrutinizing transactions to determine 
whether those transactions are consistent with the VASP’s  (or other obliged 
entity’s) information about the customer and the nature and purpose of the 
business relationship, wherever appropriate. Monitoring transactions also involves 
identifying changes to the customer profile ( e.g., the customer’s behaviour, us e of 
products, and the amounts involved) and keeping it up-to-date, which may require 
the application of enhanced CDD measures. Monitoring transactions is an essential 
component in identifying transactions that are potentially suspicious, including in 
the context of VA transactions. Transactions that do not fit the behaviour expected 
from a customer profile, or that deviate from the usual pattern of transactions, may 
be potentially suspicious.  
276. Monitoring should be carried out on a continuous basis and may also be triggered 
by specific transactions. Where large volumes of transactions occur on a regular 
basis, automated systems may be the only realistic method of monitoring 
transactions, and flagged transactions should go through human/expert analysis to 
determine if such transactions are suspicious. VASPs and other obliged entities 
should understand their operating rules, verify their integrity on a regular basis, 
and check that they account for the identified ML/TF risks associated with VAs, 
products or services or VA financial activities.  
277. VASPs and other obliged entities should adjust the extent and depth of their 
monitoring in line with their institutional risk assessment  and their individual 
customer risk profiles including the type of transactions that they allow ( e.g. 
transactions to/from unhosted wallets). If VASPs assess the risks of transfers 
to/from unhosted wallets to be unacceptably high, the VASPs may consider 
choosing to subject such wallets to enhanced monitoring or to limit or not accept 
transactions with such wallets. Enhanced monitoring should be required for higher-
risk situations (as described in Sections II and III) and extend beyond the immediate 
transaction between the VASP or its customer or counterparty. The adequacy of 
monitoring systems and the factors that lead VASPs and other obliged entities to 
adjust the level of monitoring should be reviewed regularly for continued relevance 
to their AML/CFT risk programme.  
278. Monitoring under a RBA allows VASPs or other obliged entities to create monetary 
or other thresholds to determine which activities will be reviewed. Defined 
situations or thresholds used for this purpose should be reviewed on a regular basis 
to determine their adequacy for the risk levels established. VASPs and other obliged 
entities should document and state clearly the criteria and parameters used for 
customer segmentation and for the allocation of a risk level for each of the clusters 
of customers, where applicable. The criteria applied to decide the frequency and 
intensity of the monitoring of different customer (or even VA product) segments 
should also be transparent. To this end, VASPs and other obliged entities should 
properly document, retain, and communicate to the relevant personnel and national 
competent authorities the results of their monitoring as well as any queries raised 
and resolved.

Politically exposed persons  
279. Recommendation 12. For domestic PEPs54 and international organisation PEPs,55 
obliged entities, such as VASPs, must take reasonable measures to determine 
whether a customer or beneficial owner is a domestic or international organisation 
PEP and then assess the risk of the business relationship. For higher -risk business 
relationships with domestic PEPs and international organisation PEPs, VASPs and 
other obl iged entities should take additional measures consistent with those 
applicable to foreign PEPs, including identifying the source of wealth and source of 
funds when relevant.56 
Correspondent banking and other similar relationships  
280. Recommendation 13. “Correspondent banking” does not include one -off 
transactions (see Recommendation 13 in Section III), but rather is characterised by 
its on-going, repetitive nature. VASPs should establish their control framework, by 
defining and assessing the characteristics of their counterparty VASP relationships 
and whether they are undertaking activities similar to correspondent banking. This 
should include considering their competent authorities’ views on any identified 
high risk counterparty VASP relationships. Further information on the counterparty 
VASP due diligence process is also set out in Recommendation 16. 
Wire transfers and the ‘travel rule’ 
281. Recommendation 16. As noted in Section III, providers in this space must comply 
with the requirements of Recommendation 16 (i. e. the ‘travel rule’). This includes 
the obligation to obtain, hold, and submit required originator and beneficiary 
information associated with VA transfers in order to identify and report suspicious 
transactions, take freezing actions, and prohibit transa ctions with designated 
persons and entities. The requirements apply to both VASPs and other obliged 
entities such as FIs when they send or receive VA transfers on behalf of a customer. 
Data submission technology 
282. The FATF takes a technology-neutral approach and does not prescribe a particular 
technology or software approach that providers should deploy to comply with 
Recommendation 16. Any technology or software solution is acceptable, so long as 
it enables the ordering and beneficiary institution (where pre sent in the 
transaction) to comply with its AML/CFT obligations. For example, a solution for 
obtaining, holding, and transmitting the required information (in addition to 
complying with the various other requirements of Recommendation 16) could be 
code that is built into the VA transfer’s underlying DLT transaction protocol or that 
                                                      
54  “Domestic PEPs” are individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with 
prominent public functions, for example Heads of State or o f government, senior 
politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state 
owned corporations, important political party officials (FATF Glossary). 
55  “Persons who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function by  an international 
organisation” refers to members of senior management, i.e., directors, deputy directors, and 
members of the board or equivalent functions (FATF Glossary). 
56  Further information on PEPs is set out in the 2013 FATF Guidance on Politically Exposed 
Persons (Recommendations 12 and 22). 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  83 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
runs on top of the DLT platform (e.g., using a smart contract, multiple-signature, or 
any other technology); an independent ( i.e., non -DLT) messaging platform or 
application prog ram interface (API); or any other effective means for complying 
with the Recommendation 16 measures. 
283. These technological solutions should enable VASPs to comply with the travel rule in 
an effective and efficient manner and enable a VASP to carry out the following main 
actions:  
a. enable a VASP to locate counterparty VASPs for VA transfers; 
b. enable the submission of required and accurate originator and required 
beneficiary information immediately when a VA transfer is conducted on a 
DLT platform;  
c. enable VASPs to submit a reasonably large volume of transactions to multiple 
destinations in an effectively stable manner;  
d. enable a VASP to securely transmit data, i.e. protect the integrity and 
availability of the required information to facilitate record-keeping; 
e. protect the use of such information by receiving VASPs or other obliged 
entities as well as to protect it from unauthorized disclosure in line with 
national privacy and data protection laws; 
f. provide a VASP with a communication channel to support further foll ow-up 
with a counterparty VASP for the purpose of: 
o due diligence on the counterparty VASP; and 
o requesting information on a certain transaction to determine if the 
transaction involves high risk or prohibited activities. 
284. VASPs or other obliged entities should implement mechanisms to ensure effective 
scrutiny of transactions to identify STRs, taking account of the information obtained 
through the above communication infrastructure. This could be done by combining 
other customer information, transaction histor y, and additional transaction data 
that it or its counterparty VASP obtained from its customer. VASPs should also 
ensure that they are screening transactions to meet their sanctions obligations. 
Further information on this process is set out in the discussion of Recommendation 
16 in Section III of this Guidance.  When VASPs or other obliged entities  consider 
selecting a technological solution for compliance with the travel rule, they should 
consider the above control needs.  
285. VASPs and other obliged entities in VA transfers, whether as an ordering or 
beneficiary institution, should consider how they might leverage existing 
commercially available technology to comply with the requirements of 
Recommendation 16, and specifically the requirements of INR. 15, paragraph 7(b). 
Examples of existing technologies that providers could consider as a foundation for 
enabling the identification of beneficiaries of VA transfers as well as the 
transmission of required originator and beneficiary in near real -time before a VA 
transfer is conducted on a DLT platform include: 
a. Public and private keys, which are created in pairs for each entity involved in a 
transmission and encrypt and decrypt information during the initial part of 
the transmission so that only the sender and recipient of the transmission can 
84  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
decrypt and read the information, wherein the public key is available to 
everyone while the private key is known only to the creator of the keys; 
b. Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) connections , which 
make use  of public and private keys among parties when establishing a 
connection and secure almost all transmissions on the Internet, including 
emails, web browsing, logins, and financial transactions, ensuring that all data 
that passes between a web server and a browser remains private and secure; 
c. X.509 certificates , which are digital certificates administered by certificate 
authorities that use the X.509 PKI standard to verify that a public key belongs 
to the user, computer, or service identity in the certificate and which are used 
worldwide across public and private sectors; 
d. X.509 attribute certificates, which can encode attributes (such as name, date of 
birth, address, and unique identifier number), are attached cryptographically 
to the X.509 certificate, and ar e administered by attribute certificate 
authorities; 
e. API technology , which provides routines, protocols, and tools for building 
software applications and specifies how software components should interact; 
as well as 
f. Other commercially available technology or potential software or data sharing 
solutions. 
Counterparty VASP identification and due diligence  
286. Not all VASPs are the same. They vary in size from small independent businesses to 
large multinational corporations. Similarly, no country’s AML/CFT regime  for 
VASPs is exactly the same and countries are introducing their measures at different 
paces. Different entities within a sector will pose higher or lower risks depending 
on a variety of factors, including products, services, customers, geography, the 
AML/CFT regime in the VASP’s jurisdiction and the strength of the entity’s 
compliance program. VASPs should analyse and seek to understand how the ML/TF 
risks they identify affect them and take appropriate measures to mitigate and 
manage those risks. The risk assessment, therefore, provides the basis for the risk-
based application of AML/CFT measures.  
287. As long as global implementation of the FATF Standards on VASPs remains lacking, 
managing these kinds of relationships will pose a continuing challenge. This 
underscores the importance of implementation and suggests that VASPs will have 
to consider additional control measures for countries with weak implementation, 
such as intensive monitoring of transactions with VASPs based in the country, 
placing amount restr ictions on transactions, or intensive and frequent due 
diligence. Examples include VASPs restricting VA transfers to within their customer 
base (i.e., internal transfers of VAs within the same VASP), only allowing confirmed 
first-party transfers outside of  their customer base ( i.e., the originator and the 
beneficiary are confirmed to be the same person) and enhanced monitoring of 
transactions. Otherwise, the VASP may face a tough decision in whether to deal with 
VASPs based in a country with weak or non-existent implementation.  
288. VASPs and FIs should consider this Guidance in conjunction with the FATF Guidance 
on Correspondent Banking Services. Although a counterparty VASP relationship 
may not be a correspondent banking relationship, there are similarities in  the 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  85 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
approach to counterparty due diligence which can be of assistance to VASPs. 
Accordingly, the process set out in Recommendation 13 is referenced in this 
Guidance.  
289. When establishing a new counterparty VASP relationship, a VASP may obtain 
information set out by Recommendations 10 and 13 directly from the counterparty 
VASP. Under the requirements of those Recommendations, this information should 
be verified.  Examples of potential reliable, independent sources of information for 
the verification of the id entity and beneficial ownership of legal persons and 
arrangements include: corporate registries, registries maintained by competent 
authorities on the creation or regulated institutions list (e.g. VASP lists maintained 
by each jurisdictions where available), registries of beneficial ownership and other 
examples mentioned in the BCBS General Guide on Account Opening.57  
290. Some examples of potential sources of information on level of risks include, but are 
not limited to: the AML/CFT laws and regulations of the home country or the host 
country where the respondent institution is doing business and how they apply, 
public databases of legal decisions and/or regulatory or enforcement actions, 
annual reports that have been filed with a stock exchange, country assessm ent 
reports or other information published by international bodies which measure 
compliance and address ML/TF risks (including the FATF, FSRBs, BCBS, IMF and 
World Bank), lists issued by the FATF in the context of its International Co -
operation Review Grou p process, reputable newspapers, journals or other open 
source electronic media, third party databases, national or supranational risk 
assessments, information from the respondent institution’s management and 
compliance officer(s) and public information from the regulator and supervisor. 
291. The VASP would need to assess the counterparty VASP’s AML/CFT controls to avoid 
submitting their customer information to illicit actors or sanctioned entities and 
should also consider whether there is a reasonable basis to believe the VASP can 
adequately protect sensitive information. This is similar to the process set out in 
FATF Recommendation 13, sub-paragraph (b), but in a more risk-based manner. In 
practice, such an assessment could involve reviewing the counterparty’s AML/CFT 
systems and controls framework.58 The assessment should include confirming that 
the counterparty’s AML/CFT controls are subject to independent audit (which could 
be external or internal).  VASPs should have recourse to altered procedures, 
including t he possibility of not sending user information, when they reasonably 
believe a counterparty VASP will not handle it securely while continuing to execute 
the transfer if they believe the AML/CFT risks are acceptable. In these 
circumstances, VASPs should ide ntify an alternative procedure , whose control 
design could be duly reviewed by their supervisors when requested.  
292. For clarity, a VASP needs to undertake counterparty VASP due diligence before they 
transmit the required information for compliance with paragraph 7(b) of INR.15 to 
their counterparty. VASPs do not need to undertake the counterparty VASP due 
diligence process for every VA transfer . They should however refresh their 
counterparty due diligence information periodically or when risk emerges from the 
                                                      
57  Annex 4, General guide to account opening, www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d505.htm. 
58  For example, one of the tools that used in the banking sector to fulfil their correspondent 
banking obligations is the Wolfsberg questionnaire. This provides a starting -point for a 
potential framework in the VASP counterparty due diligence context.  
86  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
relationship to determine if they remain comfortable submitting their  information 
to the counterparty in line with the RBA controls defined by the VASP. 
Submission of required information  
293. As set forth in INR. 15, paragraph 7(b), it is vital that VASPs a nd other obliged 
entities that engage in VA transfers submit the required information in a secure 
manner, so as to protect the user information associated with the VA transfers 
against unauthorized disclosures and enable receiving entities to effectively comply 
with their own AML/CFT obligations, including identifying suspicious VA transfers, 
taking freezing actions, and prohibiting transactions with designated persons and 
entities. Further it is essential that providers submit the required information 
immediately—that is, simultaneously or concurrent with the transfer itself —
particularly given the cross -border nature, global reach, and transaction speed of 
VA activities. See the discussion of the travel rule in Section III for further 
information.  
294. VASPs must transmit relevant originator and beneficiary information as set out in 
the INR. 16. Countries may adopt a de minimis threshold for VA transfers, below 
which verification of the customer and beneficiary information is not required 
unless there is a ML/TF  suspicion. That is, for occasional VA transfers below 
USD/EUR 1 000, or the equivalent amount in local currency, or per defined in local 
regulations, the requirements of INR.16 apply and the name of the originator and of 
the beneficiary will be requested,  as well as a wallet address for each or a unique 
transaction reference number. However, such information will not have to be 
verified unless there are suspicious circumstances related to ML/TF, in which case 
information pertaining to the customer should be verified. 
VA transfers to/from unhosted wallet 
295. VASPs and obliged entities may undertake transfers to non -obliged entities (i.e., 
unhosted wallets). In such circumstances, a VASP should obtain the required 
originator and beneficiary information from their  customer, because they cannot 
obtain the relevant information from another VASP. Such transfers would fall within 
scope of the VASP’s broader AML/CFT obligations, such as transaction monitoring 
and targeted financial sanctions compliance.  
296. VASPs should be aware of the risk posed by VA transfers to/from unhosted wallets 
and related P2P transactions. Such transactions may be attractive to illicit actors 
due to anonymity, the lack of limits on portability, mobility, transaction speed, and 
usability. Therefore, VASPs should collect data on their unhosted wallet transfers, 
and monitor and assess that information as necessary to determine to what extent  
a transaction is within their risk appetite, and the appropriate risk -based controls 
to apply to such a transac tion/individual customer, and to meet STR obligations  
(see also Recommendation 20 in Section III).  Similar logic would apply in 
considering the risks posed by VASPs that are not yet licensed/registered and 
supervised for AML/CFT purposes, as they are based  in a jurisdiction that has not 
yet implemented the FATF Standards for VAs/VASPs.  
297. A VASP may choose to impose additional limitations, controls, or prohibitions on 
transactions with unhosted wallets in line with their risk analysis. Potential 
measures include: 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  87 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
a. enhancing existing risk -based control framework to account for 
specific risks posed by transactions with unhosted wallets (e.g., 
accounting for specific users, patterns of observed conduct, local and 
regional risks, and information from regulators and  law 
enforcement); and 
b. studying the feasibility of accepting transactions only from/to VASPs 
and other obliged entities, and/or unhosted wallets that the VASP has 
assessed to be reliable. 
 Internal controls and foreign branches and subsidiaries  
298. Recommendation 18. The successful implementation and effective operation of a 
RBA to AML/CFT depends on strong senior management leadership, which includes 
oversight of the development and implementation of the RBA across the VASP 
sector. Recommendation 18 also requ ires information sharing within the group, 
where relevant, regarding in particular unusual transactions or activities.  
299. VASP and other obliged entities should maintain AML/CFT programmes and 
systems that are adequate to manage and mitigate their risks. The nature and extent 
of the AML/CFT controls will depend upon a number of factors, including the nature, 
scale and complexity of the VASP’s business, the diversity of its operations, 
including geographical diversity, its customer base, product and activity profile, and 
the degree of risk associated with each area of its operations, among other factors.  
STR reporting and tipping-off 
300. Recommendation 20. VASPs and other obliged entities that engage in or provide 
VA activities, products, and services should have the ability to flag for further 
analysis any unusual or suspicious movements of funds or transactions—including 
those involving or relating to VAs —or activity that is otherwise indicative of 
potential involvement in illicit activity regardless of whether t he transactions or 
activities are fiat-to-fiat, virtual-to-virtual, fiat-to-virtual, or virtual-to-fiat in nature. 
VASPs and other obliged entities should have appropriate systems so that such 
funds or transactions are scrutinised in a timely manner and a determination can 
be made as to whether funds or transactions are suspicious.  
301. VASPs and other obliged entities should promptly report funds or transactions, 
including those involving or relating to VAs and/or providers that are suspicious to 
the FIU and i n the manner specified by competent authorities. The processes that 
VASPs and other obliged entities put in place to escalate their suspicions and 
ultimately report to the FIU should reflect this. While VASPs and other obliged 
entities can apply the policies and processes that lead them to form a suspicion on 
a risk-sensitive basis, they should report their ML/TF suspicions once formed and 
regardless of the amount of the transaction or whether the transaction has 
completed. The obligation for VASPs and other obliged entities to report suspicious 
transactions is therefore not risk -based, nor does the act of reporting discharge 
them from their other AML/CFT obligations. Further, VASPs and other obliged 
entities should comply with applicable STR requirements ev en when operating 
across different jurisdictions.  
302. Consistent with INR. 15 and in relation to Recommendation 16, in the case of a VASP 
(or other obliged entity) that controls both the ordering and the beneficiary side of 
88  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
a VA funds or wire transfer, the VA SP or other obliged entity should take into 
account all of the information from both the ordering and beneficiary sides in order 
to determine whether the information gives rise to suspicion and, where necessary, 
file an STR with the appropriate FIU and mak e relevant transaction information 
available to the FIU . The lack of required originator or beneficiary information 
should be considered as a factor in assessing whether a transfer involving VAs or 
VASPs is suspicious and whether it is thus required to be reported to the FIU. The 
same holds true for other obliged entities such as traditional FIs involved in a 
transfer involving VAs or VASPs. 
303. Where the VASP requests further information on a counterparty or information 
from its customer in case the VASP receiving a VA transfer from an entity that is not 
a VASP or other obliged entity, it expects their customer to respond in a timely 
fashion and provide documents/information to the level of detail requested. Where 
their customer does not answer, it may trigger concerns for a VASP on their 
customer being unable to reasonably explain the soundness of its transaction and 
lead the VASP to consider the filing of a STR on their customer. A request for 
information could be followed by a reassessment of the customer’s a ttributes and 
risk profile when necessary. 
304. Further information on red -flag indicators for VAs that could suggest criminal 
behaviour are set out in the FATF’s  Virtual Asset Red Flag Indicators of Money 
Laundering and Terrorist Financing. These indicators help VASPs and other obliged 
entities to detect and report suspicious transactions involving VAs. Key indicators 
include: 
a. Technological features that increase anonymity - such as mixers, tumblers or 
AECs; 
b. Geographical risks - criminals can exploit countries with weak, or absent, 
national measures for VAs; 
c. Transaction patterns – including transactions which are structured to avoid 
reporting or appear irregular, unusual or uncommon; 
d. Transaction size – if the amount and frequency has no logical business 
explanation; 
e. Sender or recipient profiles; and 
f. Source of funds or wealth.

PART FIVE: 
COUNTRY EXAMPLES OF RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL 
ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
Summary of Jurisdictional Approaches to Regulating and Supervising VA Activities and 
VASPs 
305. Section V provides an overview of various jurisdictional approaches to regulating 
and supervising VA financial activities and related providers, including approaches 
to having in place tools and other measures for sanctioning or taking enforcement 
actions against persons that fail to comply with their AML/CFT obligations, which 
countries might consider when developing or enhancing th eir own national 
frameworks. Some of t hese countries have not yet been assessed for their 
compliance with the requirements set forth in INR. 15. 
Italy  
306. In Italy, Legislative Decree No. 231 of 2007, amended by Legislative Decrees No. 90 
of 2017 and No. 125/ 2019, includes providers engaged in the five functional 
activities as defined by the FATF, as recipients of AML/CFT obligations.   
307. Service providers related to VAs are required to be listed in a special section of the 
register held by “Organismo degli Agenti e dei Mediatori” (OAM). The registration is 
a precondition for service providers related to VAs in order to carry out their 
activity in Italy. Work is currently ongoing to implement the register. 
308. VASPs are considered obliged entities and are subject to the full set of AML/CFT 
measures. 
309. On March 21, 2019, Italy adopted the update of the National Risk Assessment (NRA). 
It includes an assessment of the ML/TF risks emanating from VAs. The results of the 
updated NRA will be used in order to strengthen the nat ional strategy. Obliged 
entities and subjects (financial and non -financial) are requested to take into 
consideration the results of the updated NRA in order to conduct/update their risk 
assessment.  
310. The STRs and the further analysis conducted by the Italia n FIU (UIF) permit it to 
collect information about: i) VASPs operating in Italy, including business data 
(typology of service provided); location; data on the beneficial owner, administrator 
and other connected subjects; ii) detailed information on single transactions (e.g., 
date, amount, executor, counterparts, and wallet accounts); data on the bank 
accounts involved ( e.g., holder, power of attorney, origin/use of the funds, and 
general features of the financial flows); iii) data on the personal and econom ic 
profile of the customer or the holder of the wallet; information useful to match VA 
addresses to the identity of the owner of the VAs; unambiguous identification data 
90  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
(e.g., fiscal code and VAT number); iv) wallet or account information ( e.g., overall 
amount of VAs owned by one or more subjects; detailed information on main 
movements of VAs traced back to the same subject or linked subjects in a specific 
timeframe; wallet/account statement in an editable format; and v) type and main 
features of VAs.  
311. Since 2015, the Bank of Italy has warned consumers on the high risks of buying 
and/or holding VAs as well as supervised financial intermediaries about the 
possible risks associated with VAs. In particular, it issued a warning for consumers 
and a communication  for supervised financial intermediaries (January 2015) as 
well as a new warning for consumers which recalled the one issued by the three 
European financial authorities —European Securities and Markets Authority 
(ESMA), the European Banking Authority (EBA),  and the European Insurance and 
Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in March 2018. The UIF, in order to 
enhance the engagement with the private sector, issued a Communication on 
January 30, 2015 about the anomalous use of crypto-assets, addressing particularly 
the FIs ( i.e., banks and payment institutions) as well as gambling operators, and 
underlining the necessity for these obliged entities to focus their attention on 
possible anomalous transactions, such as wire transfers, cash deposits and 
withdrawals, use of prepaid cards, associated with crypto -assets purchases or 
investments. 
312. The UIF is progressing its analysis, focussing on new risks and emerging trends. An 
updated Communication was issued in 2019 to assist obliged entities in performing 
their ta sks. In particular, the UIF updated its 2015 Communication on the 
anomalous use of crypto -assets by providing more details on recurring elements, 
operational methods, and behavioural risk profiles identified in STRs related to VAs. 
The Communication sets o ut specific instructions for filling in data in the pre -set 
STRs’ format, particularly with reference to information about: VASPs, transactions, 
users/customers, and wallets/accounts. 
313. In December 2016 and July 2018, the UIF published collections of sanitized ML/TF 
cases that emerged in the course of financial analyses, including typologies 
connected to the anomalous use of VAs. 
Finland  
314. The Act on Virtual Currency Providers (572/2019) came into force on May 1st 2019. 
VASPs are required to register (authoriz ation) with the Finnish Financial 
Supervisory Authority (FIN -FSA).59 Those who already provided services before 
legislation came into force, needed to be registered by November 1st 2019. New 
actors had to be registered prior to starting their operations. Th e definition of 
VASPs includes exchanges (both fiat to VAs and between VAs as well as VAs and 
other goods such as gold), custodian wallet providers, and issuers of virtual 
currency. The requirements for registration include basic fit and proper checks, 
requirements for handling customer funds, and simple rules regarding marketing 
(i.e., an obligation to give all relevant information and an obligation for truthful 
information). VASPs are obliged entities as defined in the AML Act (444/2017) and 
were required  to comply with AML/CFT obligations from December 1st 2019.

© FATF/OECD 2021 
VASP's AML/CFT risk assessment and their procedures and guidelines relating to 
AML/CFT are reviewed as part of the registration process.  
315. FIN-FSA was given powers to issue regulations and guidelin es on certain parts of 
VASP activity. The FIN-FSA regulations and guidelines entered into force on July 1st 
2019.60 The regulations contain regulation on holding and protecting client money 
and segregation of client money and own funds. Guidelines concern c ompliance 
with AML/CFT legislation.  
316. Prior to the Act, the FIN -FSA had been working with organizers of ICOs from the 
point of view of securities markets legislation and financial instruments. The aim 
had been to identify when the VA was a financial instrum ent ( i.e., transferable 
security). These assessments are still required occasionally. In order to facilitate the 
assessment on the nature of the asset to be issued, the FIN -FSA has drafted a 
checklist that is used in all ICO-related enquiries. The checklist as well as frequently 
asked questions related to VAs are available at the FIN-FSA website.61  
317. The FIN -FSA supervisory experience has shown that VASPs are now willing and 
keen on being regulated and trying to seek supervisors ’ endorsement for their 
activities. The challenge is to communicate to the general public that authorization 
does not equal endorsement. VASPs have had challenges in opening bank accounts, 
which could partly explain the change in their attitude towards regulation. 
Japan 
318. Japan amended th e Payment Services Act and Act on Prevention of Transfer of 
Criminal Proceeds (PTCP Act) in 2016 in response to the bankruptcy of a large VASP 
in 2014 and the 2015 FATF VC Guidance. Following the enactment of the laws in 
April 2017, the JFSA established a VASP monitoring team in August 2017, composed 
of AML/CFT and technology specialists. 
319. As a part of its registration procedure, the JFSA assesses applicants’ AML/CFT 
programs, with a focus on consistency between the applicants’ risk assessment and 
their busi ness plan, through document -based assessment and off -site or on -site 
interviews with them (as of July 2021, 31 VASPs are registered). 
320. In order to ensure predictability and transparency of the registration process from 
the applicants’ viewpoint, the form of the questionnaire that applicants are required 
to fill in for the registration process was published in October 2018. Based on the 
knowledge and experience accumulated through past monitoring and registration 
examinations, the content of the questionnaire  was revised by consolidating and 
eliminating some items. It was then re -published in April 2020, aiming at enabling 
JFSA to examine the AML/CFT regime more efficiently, especially for the items 
where more intensive risk management is required.

321. JFSA conducts the registration process as follows: 
a. sending the questionnaire to applicants, which is published on JFSA website; 
b. based on the answer the applicant provides, JFSA asks further questions and 
requests evidence, where necessary; 
c. conduct interviews with the board members about their mindset toward risk 
management as well as the business plan. 
d. proceed with registration examination on a document basis, focusing on: 1) 
risk management of the VA they will deal with; 2) segregation management of 
customers' ass ets; 3) IT system management; 4) AML/CFT regime; 5) 
outsourcing management; 6) business management including internal audit 
regime; 
e. based on the results of the previous processes, JFSA makes it a rule to visit the 
applicant's office to verify the effective ness of the planned operation of the 
rules and policies, especially for their risk management regime (on -site 
examination); and 
f. once JFSA confirms there are no concerns about their operation throughout 
the entire registration examination, JFSA accepts the application, and then 
gives registration. 
322. JFSA annually collects AML/CFT statistical and qualitative data from obliged entities 
for JFSA to assess their risk exposure, and assign risk rating on individual obliged 
entities based on the methodology JFSA deve loped, which will be then used to 
develop annual off -site monitoring plan. For example, JFSA has conducted on -site 
inspections of 22 VASPs (including 13 then-deemed VASPs, i.e., entities which were 
already in business before the enactment of the amended ac t, being allowed to 
operate on a tentative basis) and has imposed administrative dispositions (21 
business improvement orders and six business termination orders and one refusal 
of registration) by March 2019. 
323. The source data collected from obliged entitie s are approximately 60 KPI data, 
which are tail ored to each sector . For the VASP sector, JFSA collects  the following 
information, which are non-exclusive and subject to annual revision:  
g. whether blockchain analysis tools are used for transaction monitoring and/or 
risk analysis purposes;  
h. the type of VAs offered to the VASP’s customers; 
i. the number of customer identified for its usage history of mixers and/or 
tumblers;  
j. the percentage of hot wallet vs. cold wallet usage allocation; 
k. whether or not the VASP acc epts corporate clients as customers (number of 
accounts, transaction value); 
l. whether or not the VASP offers business payment services; 
m. the attributes of counterparty VASPs (geographical distribution and 
transaction volume); and  
n. the number and geographical location of VA ATMs the VASP manages.

© FATF/OECD 2021 
324. The JFSA also closely co -operates with the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange 
Association (JVCEA), the self-regulatory body certified in October 2018, for prompt 
and flexible response to VASP-related issues. The JVCEA functions as an educational 
body and a monitoring body for the member VASPs. Compliance with self -
regulatory AML/CFT rules and guidelines is prepared by the JVCEA. The JFSA, in 
consultation with the JVCEA, has conducted outreach, some of which was done in 
collaboration with other authorities, sharing information and ideas with VASPs that 
would contribute to improving their AML/CFT compliance. 
325. In addition, the JFSA: 
 Established the “Study Group on the Virtual Currency Exchange Business” in 
March 2018 to examine institutional responses to various issues related to 
the VASP business. In light of suggestions made on a report compiled by 
the Group, the JFSA, in March 2019, submitted to the Diet a bill to amend 
the acts. The amendment includes: the application of the Payment Services 
Act and PTCP Act to service providers who conduct custodian service of 
VAs; and the introduction of ex ante notification system concerning each 
change of a type of VA dealt in by VASPs taking into account the anonymity 
of VAs. 
 Prepared a nd publicized red flag indicators of suspicious transactions, 
which are specific to VASPs, in April 2019. The indicators cover several 
transactions where anonymization technology was utilized. 
326. The amended Payment Services Act came into effect in May 2020 ( enacted in May 
2019). By this amendment, so -called crypto-asset custodial services, consisting of 
managing (safekeeping/administrating) crypto-assets on behalf of customers and 
transferring to designated addresses upon instructions from customers without 
trading, etc., are also subject to the regulation 
327. With regard to the travel rule, the JVCEA, which is a self-regulatory organization of 
the Japanese VASP sector, aims to introduce the travel rule by revising its self -
regulatory rules and by setting the target date, and JFSA has been strengthening co-
operation with the JVCEA on this matter. 
328. In March 2021, from the perspective of ensuring the proper and reliable execution 
of their business, JFSA issued a request to JVCEA to proceed with consideration for 
appropriate implementation of the travel rule, to resolve technical and operational 
issues, and to establish the necessary systems to implement the travel rule.  
329. JFSA has conducted extensive dialogue with the VASP industry in preparation for 
the introduction of the travel rule. JFSA will continue to strengthen this dialogue and 
monitor industry’s correspondence and progress with the travel rule as 
appropriate.  
Mexico  
330. In Mexico, Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Operations with 
Resources of I llegal Proceeds  was reformed in March 2018 to establish as a 
Vulnerable Activity  the exchange of VAs made by entities other than Financial 
Technology Institutions and Credit Institutions. 
331. Likewise, in March 2018, Mexico published the Law to Regulate Financ ial 
Technology Institutions, which indicates that Financial Technology Institutions may 
94  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
operate with VAs provided that they have the authorization of Bank of Mexico and 
operate with the VA that it determinates. 
332. Subsequently, in September 2018, the standard s that establish the measures and 
procedures in terms of AML/CFT related to VAs were published. 
333. In March 2019, the Central Bank published the standards to define the internal 
operations that the Credit Institutions and the Financial Technology Institutions  
directly or indirectly pretend to carry out operations with VA. 
334. The Central Bank said that VAs carry a significant ML/TF risk, due to the ease of 
transferring VA to different countries as well as the absence of homogeneous 
controls and prevention measures at the global level. However, it seeks to promote 
the use of technologies that could have a benefit, as long as these technologies are 
used internally between Financial Technology Institutions and Credit Institutions. 
335. Finally, later in March 2019, the Disposiciones de carácter general a que se refiere el 
Artículo 115 de la Ley de Instituciones Crédito were reformed, establishing the 
measures and procedures that the credit institutions must follow to comply with 
the obligations regarding AML/CFT related to VAs.  
Norway  
336. VASPs have been subject to the Norwegian AML Act and its obligations since 
October 15, 2018. The relevant provision of the AML regulation reads as follows  
(last updated in May 2021 – unofficial translation):: 
Box 5. Section 1-3 Application of the Anti-Money Laundering Act to 
Virtual Currency - Requirements for registration of providers of 
exchange and custodianship services. Recall 
(1) Providers of exchange services between virtual currency and official 
currency are obliged entities within the mea ning of the Anti -Money 
Laundering Act if they are 
a. registered in the business Registry in Norway, or 
b. operate from Norway, or 
c. directed towards the Norwegian market. 
This shall apply correspondingly to virtual currency custodianship 
services. 
(2) By virtual currency is meant a digital expression of value, which is not 
issued by a central bank or a government authority, which is not 
necessarily attached to a legally established currency and does not 
possess a legal status of currency or money, but which is accepted as a 
means of exchange, and which can be transferred, stored or traded 
electronically. 
(3) By virtual currency custodianship services is meant the custodianship 
of private cryptographic keys on behalf of customers, for purposes of 
transferring, storing or trading in virtual currency. 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  95 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
(4) Providers as mentioned in paragraph 1 can only be offered by legal 
entities registered with the Financial Supervisory Authority. The 
provisions in the Anti -Money Laundering Act section 42 second to 
fourth paragraph apply correspondingly. 
(5) An application for registration must contain the following information: 
a. name of the applicant 
b. type of enterprise and organisation number 
c. business address 
d. the service which is offered 
e. name, residence address and personal identity number or d -
number on the 
a. general manager or persons in a corresponding 
position 
b. members of the board of directors or persons in a 
corresponding position 
c. any other contact person  
f. documentation in accordance with paragraph 4 
g. the enterprise’s risk assessment and policies and procedures, 
cf. the Anti-Money Laundering Act sections 7 and 8. 
(6) The Financial Supervisory Authority may supervise compliance with 
the Anti -Money Laundering Act for the providers mentioned in 
paragraph 1.  
(7) The Financial Supervisory Authority can refuse applications which do 
not fulfil the requirements of the Anti -Money Laundering Act with 
Regulations. If the requirements for a registration no longer are 
fulfilled, the Financial Supervisory Authority may recall the 
registration. 
As of October 2021, nine VASP s are registered with the FSA and thus allowed to 
provide their services within the Norwegian market. Many more have applied for 
registration, but there has been a slight drop in received applications since 2020. 
Many are also returning applicants, previously rejected due to shortcomings in their 
AML policies and procedures. Moreover, the FSA continues to issue numerous orders 
to cease and desist to those operating without permission in the Norwegian market, 
which includes both domestic and foreign-based VASPs. The identification and closing 
down of unregistered VASPs is a result of closer co -operation with the FIU, and 
follows a joint preventive project from 2019. Furthermore, the FSA conducted its first 
inspection of a VASP in late May 2021, and additional information has been gathered 
from all registered VASPs to further map the general risk of the sector and the extent 
of the services being provided. General experience, also based on attempts to register, 
shows that the sector includes a range of actors w ith differences in size, complexity, 
competence, experience with AML and compliance related work, as well as general 
professionalism. Sweden  
96  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS

337. In Sweden, the Financial Supervisory Authority has considered bitcoin and 
ethereum as means of payment since 2013,  meaning that professional exchange 
services are therefore subject to a licensing regime 62 and, following a successful 
application for a licence, AML/CFT supervision. The regulation is not an explicit 
AML/CFT regulation of VA exchange services as such ( i.e., they are not specifically 
mentioned in the law) but an implicit recognition that they should be regulated. 
Once an exchange service obtains a licence, all activities ( i.e., no matter the VA in 
question) are subject to AML/CFT regulation and supervision. Thematic 
supervision has been carried out. As a result, part of the sector has ceased its 
operations. VASPs have submitted STRs to the FIU, and feedback from operational 
authorities suggests that criminals are choosing to take their business to 
unregulated exchanges elsewhere. 
Switzerland 
338. Switzerland adopted a technology -neutral approach and applied the existing 
AML/CFT regulatory regime to VAs and the respective VASPs from an early stage in 
the development of VA related activities in the market. Under this  principle-based 
regime, all activities involving financial intermediation and related to virtual assets 
fall within the scope of the Anti -Money Laundering Act ("AMLA"). This includes 
exchange activities between VA and fiat currencies and/or between one or  more 
forms of VA, any transfer activities of virtual assets, safekeeping and/or 
administration activities of VAs or instruments enabling control over VAs and the 
issuance of payment tokens.  
339. Given the more and more decentralised models of transfer of asse ts whereby 
several persons assist in disposing over the assets, a new criteria for defining a 
service related to payment transactions  in virtual currencies has been introduced 
in the anti -money laundering ordinance. Therefore, apart from having power of 
disposal over virtual currencies for the customer, a financial intermediary is 
providing a service related to payment transactions in virtual currencies if it assists 
the transfer of virtual currencies to a third party, insofar as it has an ongoing 
business relationship with the customer. This includes for example decentralised 
trading platforms that do not hold the private key of the client but facilitate the 
transfer using a smart contract or wallet providers that facilitate a transaction even 
if not holdin g a private key directly. This modification should ensure that 
Switzerland’s AMLA is future proof with respect to VAs.   
340. Before taking up such business in Switzerland, any natural or legal persons acting 
as a financial intermediary and subject to AMLA must  either hold a prudential 
FINMA license (e.g. a banking license), become a member of a Supervisory 
Organisation ("SO") or a self-regulatory organization ("OAR"), both of which are in 
turn supervised by FINMA. The Anti-money laundering ordinance (“AMLO”) covers 
financial intermediaries acting in or from within Switzerland.  
341. FINMA has repeatedly warned consumers of specific risks of crypto assets and 
related activities such as ICOs. In its supervision, FINMA focused early on VA-related 
topics. As an example, FINMA communicated in 2019 its expectations regarding the 
                                                      
62  It is not quite a comprehensive licensing regime in the prudential sense of the word, but 
for AML/CFT purposes it is, including fit and proper testing of owners and management 
and an assessment of whether the business will be conducted pursuant to AML/CFT 
regulation.

travel rule. In Switzerland, financial intermediaries also have to fulfil the travel rule 
requirements when offering transfers to or from an unhosted wallet. Furthermore, 
the implementation of virtual asset related requirements by supervised entities (i.e., 
banks) has been assessed by FINMA. 
United States 
Comprehensive and Technology-Neutral Framework  
342. The United States has a comprehensive and technology -neutral regulatory and 
supervisory framework in place for regulating and supervising “digital assets”63 for 
AML/CFT that subjects covered providers and activities in this space to 
substantially the same regulation that providers of non-digital assets are subject to 
within the existing AML/CFT regulator y framework for FIs. The U.S. approach 
draws on the tools and authorities of various departments and agencies, including 
the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
(FinCEN), the U.S. FIU and administrator of the primary U.S.  AML law, the Bank 
Secrecy Act (BSA); U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC); the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS); the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); 
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); the U.S. Department of 
Justice (DOJ) and other departments and agencies. FinCEN, the IRS, the SEC, and the 
CFTC and the DOJ  in particular have regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement 
authorities to oversee certain digital asset activities that involve money 
transmission; securities, commodities, or derivatives; or that have tax implications, 
and they have authority to mitigate the misuse of digital assets for illicit financial 
transactions or tax avoidance. 
343. Where a person (a term defined in U.S. regulation that goes beyond natural and legal 
persons) engages in certain financial activities involving digital assets, AML/CFT 
and other obligations apply. Depending on the activity, the person or institution is 
subject to the supervisory authority of FinCEN, the SEC, and/or the CFTC to regulate 
the person as a money transmitter, national securities exchange, broker -dealer, 
investment adviser, investment company, transfer agent, designated contract 
market, swap execution facility, derivatives clearing organization, futures 
commission merchant, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, swap 
dealer, major swap participant, retail foreign exchange dealer, or introducing 
broker. 
344. If the person falls under the regulatory definition of a “bank,” FinCEN and the U.S. 
federal banking agencies—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 
and National Credit Union Administration—have authority, sometimes concurrent 
with that of the state banking reg ulators, to regulate and supervise persons when 
they engage in financial activity involving digital assets. Moreover, existing general 
tax principles apply to transactions involving digital assets in the United States 
because the IRS classifies them as property. 
                                                      
63  From a U.S. perspective, the term “digital assets” is a comprehensive term that refers to a 
range of assets in the digital financial services ecosystem, including digital currencies —
both national digital currencies and digital currencies that are not issued or guaranteed 
by a national government, such as convertible virtual currencies like bitcoin —as well as 
digital assets that are securities, commodities, or derivatives thereof.

Box 6. Case Study: U.S. Regulation and Supervision (Including Licensing 
and Registration) of Digital Asset-Related Providers 
Money Transmission. At the federal level, FinCEN regulates as money 
transmitters any person engaged in the business of accep ting and 
transmitting value, whether physical or digital, that substitutes for 
currency (including convertible virtual currency, whether virtual -to-
virtual, virtual -to-fiat, or virtual -to-other value) from one person to 
another person or location by any me ans. Under the BSA, money 
transmitters must register with FinCEN as money services businesses 
and institute AML programs, recordkeeping, and reporting measures, 
including filing suspicious activity reports. The AML requirements apply 
equally to domestic and foreign-located money transmitters, even if the 
foreign-located entity does not have a physical presence in the United 
States and regardless of where it is incorporated or headquartered, as 
long as it does business in whole or substantial part in the United States. 
Since 2014, the IRS and FinCEN have conducted examinations of various 
digital asset -related providers, including administrators, some of the 
largest exchangers by volume, individuals conducting exchanges as a 
business for others , foreign -located exchangers, digital asset/crypto -
precious metal dealers, kiosk companies, and numerous trading 
platforms as well as registered and unregistered FIs. Applicable state 
laws also require relevant covered entities to obtain state money 
transmitter licenses in most states in which they operate, regardless of 
their jurisdiction of incorporation or the physical location of their head 
office. Money transmitters also may be subject to other regulatory 
requirements, including safety, soundness, and capital reserve 
requirements, depending on the U.S. state in which they are located or 
do business and whether or not their operations make them subject to 
the rules of other U.S. regulatory bodies. 
Securities Activity. To the extent a digital asset is a security in the United 
States, the SEC has regulatory and enforcement authority that extends 
to the offer, sale, and trading of, and other financial services and conduct 
relating to, those digital assets. Platforms on which digital assets that are 
securities are traded in the secondary market generally must register as 
national securities exchanges or operate pursuant to an exemption from 
registration, such as the exemption under SEC requirements for 
alternative trading systems ( i.e., SEC Regulation ATS), and report 
information about their operations and trading to the SEC. Even if the 
securities exchange, broker -dealer, investment adviser or other 
securities-related entity is a foreign-located person and does not have a 
physical presence in the United States, the person may be subject to SEC 
regulations and jurisdiction when they offer, sell, or conduct activities 
relating to securities (including, digital assets that are securities) to U.S. 
persons or otherwise affect the U.S. securities markets. Additional state 
licensing obligations may apply depending on the activity in which an 
entity is engaged and on the state in which the activity is conducted. 
Certain trading in digital assets, including trading on platforms, may still

© FATF/OECD 2021 
qualify as money transmission under the BSA and state laws or 
regulations, as discussed above. If the digital asset is a security, it is 
subject to SEC jurisdiction and any derivatives on the security are 
subject to SEC jurisdiction. 
 
Commodities and Derivatives Activity. In the United States, a digital  
asset may be a commodity, as defined by the Commodity Exchange Act.64 
As such, the CFTC would generally have regulatory jurisdiction over 
derivatives on that digital asset, including futures, options, and swaps 
on that digital asset . In addition, the CFTC maintains broad anti -fraud 
and anti-manipulation authority over the sale of such a digital asset that 
is not otherwise a security. Pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act 
and related regulations, the CFTC has broad authority to take action 
against any person or entity located inside or outside the United States 
that is associated with or engaged in fraud or manipulative activity  in 
connection with a digital asset that is a non -security commodity (e.g., 
U.S. CFTC v. Blue Bit Banc). 
Generally, a natural or leg al person that transacts in securities, 
commodities or derivatives is subject to additional oversight by a self -
regulatory organization. Securities activities require registration with 
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and commodities 
and derivatives activities require registration with the National Futures 
Association (NFA). Depending on its activities, a natural or legal person 
may also require dual registration with FINRA and the NFA, both of 
which have statutory obligations under U.S.  federal securities and 
commodities laws. Additionally, similar to money transmitter licenses, a 
natural or legal person must be licensed with each state regulator for 
states in which they do business. 
Certain registrants of the SEC and CFTC also have BSA obligations, 
including establishing AML programs, reporting suspicious activity to 
FinCEN, identifying and verifying customer identity, and applying 
enhanced due diligence for certain accounts involving foreign persons. 
The relevant regulatory and supervis ory bodies also monitor digital 
asset activities and examine registrants for compliance with their 
regulatory obligations, including (for certain registrants) AML/CFT 
obligations under the BSA.

by CEA section 1a(9). In re Coinflip, Inc., d/b/a Derivabit, and  Francisco Riorda n, CFTC

U.S. Law Enforcement, Sanctions, and Other Enforcement Capabilities 
345. U.S. law enforcement uses financial intelligence information from FinCEN and other 
information to conduct investigations involving digital assets. Information from 
FinCEN—which is sourced from the reporting and analysis that FinCEN collects and 
disseminates to competent U.S. law enforcement authorities —has been useful in 
developing evidence of criminal activity and identifying individuals who may be 
involved in ML or TF activities. FinCEN has access to a wide range of financial, 
administrative, an d law enforcement information. The information at FinCEN’s 
disposal includes two key pieces of information that can be instrumental in 
detecting suspected ML or TF involving digital assets: (i) suspicious activity reports 
(or SARs) filed by reporting FIs, such as banks or broker-dealers in securities, that 
have transmitted fiat currency for conversion or exchange into a digital asset at a 
digital asset exchanger or related business or that have received fiat currency from 
a digital asset exchanger or relate d business after being converted or exchanged 
from a digital asset; and (ii) SARs filed by digital asset providers that, often 
operating as money transmitters, receive funds and convert them into a digital asset 
or allow for the storage and/or trading and exchange of digital assets. FinCEN also 
collects other information, such as foreign bank account, currency and monetary 
instrument, and currency transaction reports —all of which could contain 
investigative leads and evidence necessary to deter and prosecute criminal activity 
associated with digital assets.  
346. U.S. departments and agencies have taken strong civil and criminal enforcement 
actions in both administrative proceedings and federal court to combat illicit 
activity relating to digital assets, such as by seeking various forms of relief, including 
cease and desist orders, injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil 
money penalties for wilful violations and criminal sentences involving forfeiture 
and imprisonment.65 U.S. regulators and super visors engage extensively with one 
another, state regulators, the DOJ, and other law enforcement agencies to support 
investigative and prosecutorial efforts in the digital assets space.  
347. A variety of criminal and civil authorities, policy tools, and legal processes exist to 
assist U.S. government agencies in identifying illicit digital asset -related activity, 
attributing transactions to a specific individual or organization, mitigating threats, 
and performing analysis relating to their respective regulatory  or criminal 
investigative functions. For such investigations and prosecutions, DOJ relies on a 
range of statutory criminal and civil authorities, including federal laws governing 
money laundering, money services businesses registration, financial institut ion 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements, fraud, tax evasion, the sale of controlled 
substances and other illegal items and services, computer crimes, and terrorist 
financing. The United States has charged and prosecuted individuals operating as  
individual “peer-to-peer” exchangers for violating the BSA or for money laundering 
as well as foreign -located persons and organizations who violate U.S. law, among 
other prosecutions relating to digital assets.  
                                                      
65  Select examples of U.S. enforcement, investigative, and/or sanctions actions include: 2015 
civil money penalty against Ripple Labs, Inc. ; 2016 Operation Dark Gold ; 2017 civil 
money penalties against BTC-e and concurrent indictment of Alexander Vinnik; 2017 TF 
case, U.S. v. Zoobia Shahnaz ; 2018 sentenci ng of unlicensed bitcoin trader ; and 2019 
identification of digital currency addresses associated with OFAC SamSam designation. 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  101 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
348. Similar to FinCEN, SEC, and CFTC authorities, DOJ has broad authority to prosecute 
digital asset providers and individuals who violate U.S. law, even though they may 
not be physically located inside the United States. Where digital asset transactions 
touch financial, data storage, or other computer system s within the United States, 
for example, the DOJ has jurisdiction to prosecute persons directing or conducting 
those transactions. The United States also has jurisdiction to prosecute foreign -
located persons who use digital assets to import illegal products or contraband into 
the United States or who use U.S.-located digital asset businesses or providers or FIs 
for money laundering purposes. In addition, foreign -located persons who provide 
illicit services to, defraud, or steal from U.S. residents may be pr osecuted for 
violations of U.S. law. 
349. OFAC, typically in consultation with other agencies, administers U.S. financial 
sanctions and associated licensing, regulations, and penalties, all of which relate to 
digital assets as well as most other types of assets . OFAC has made clear that U.S. 
sanctions compliance obligations are the same, regardless of whether a transaction 
is denominated in digital assets (whether national digital currency or non-national 
digital currency such as convertible virtual currency like bitcoin) or traditional fiat 
currency, and U.S. persons and persons otherwise subject to OFAC jurisdiction are 
responsible for ensuring they do not engage in unauthorized transactions 
prohibited by OFAC sanctions. OFAC’s December 2020 enforcement action and 
associated fine for failures related to VA services provides further confirmation of 
this.66  
International Co-operation is Key 
350. The inherently global nature of the digital asset ecosystem makes digital asset 
activities particularly well suited for carry ing out and facilitating crimes that are 
transnational in nature. Customers and services can transact and operate with little 
regard to national borders, creating jurisdictional hurdles. Effectively countering 
criminal activity involving digital assets requires close international partnerships.  
351. U.S. departments and agencies, particularly U.S. law enforcement, work closely with 
foreign partners in conducting investigations, making arrests, and seizing criminal 
assets in cases involving digital asset activit y. The United States has encouraged 
these partnerships to support multi-jurisdictional investigations and prosecutions, 
particularly those involving foreign -located persons, digital asset providers, and 
transnational criminal organizations. Mutual legal assistance requests remain a key 
mechanism for enhancing co -operation. Because illicit actors can quickly destroy, 
dissipate, or conceal digital assets and related evidence, the United States has 
developed policies for obtaining evidence and restraining asse ts located abroad, 
recognizing that digital assets and the associated transactional data and evidence 
may be stored or located via technological means and processes not contemplated 
by current legal methods and treaties.

PART SIX: 
PRINCIPLES OF INFORMATION-SHARING AND CO-OPERATION 
AMONGST VASP SUPERVISORS 
352. The FATF Recommendations encourage providing the fullest range of international 
co-operation. INR. 15 states that countries should rapidly, constructively, and 
effectively provide the widest possible ran ge of international co -operation in 
relation to money laundering, predicate offences, and terrorist financing relating to 
VAs, on the basis set out in Recommendations 37 to 40. In particular, supervisors of 
VASPs should exchange information promptly and constructively with their foreign 
counterparts, regardless of the supervisors’ nature or status and differences in the 
nomenclature or status of VASPs. Further information on the application of 
Recommendations 37 to 40 to VAs is set out in Section III above.  
Objectives   
353. Each country must designate at least one competent authority as their supervisor 
of VASPs for AML/CFT purposes. Other than specifying that the competent 
authority cannot be a SRB, the FATF Standards do not specify who the competent 
authority should be. Countries have designated a range of different authorities as 
VASP supervisors, including financial services supervisors, central banks, securities 
regulators, tax authorities, FIUs and specialist VASP supervisors. Some countries 
have one single supervisor while others have multiple supervisors. Some countries 
treat VASPs as a clearly -identifiable, specific category of business, while others 
consider VASPs to be a sub -set of pre -existing business categories (e.g. as money 
service businesses).  
354. The FATF Standards make clear that supervisors should exchange information 
promptly and constructively with their foreign counterparts, regardless of the 
supervisors’ nature or status and differences in the nomenclature or status of 
VASPs. Given the pseudon ymous, fast -paced, cross -border nature of VAs, 
international co -operation is all the more critical between VASP supervisors. To 
facilitate co -operation between counterparts and exchange relevant information, 
the FATF has developed Principles of Information -Sharing and Co -operation 
between VASP Supervisors.  These principles are intended to: 
a. provide a common understanding of the type of supervisory information and 
other background knowledge that will be useful for authorities to share with 
each other and when to share such information;  
b. outline possible triggers for proactive information sharing/requests, for 
example when a cybersecurity incident has taken place that has potential 
AML/CFT impact on other jurisdictions or where a foreign -based VASP is 
potentially conducting unregulated VASP activity in a jurisdiction; 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  103 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
c. set out possible methods of sharing and types of supervisory 
assistance/feedback that could be adopted in certain circumstances (in line 
with confidentiality provisions);  
d. set out possible roles and expectations where multiple AML/CFT supervisors 
are working together on a specific case or issue; 
e. suggest possible guidelines for jurisdictions, when dealing with issues with 
VASPs in jurisdictions that do not have regulatory frameworks in place, or 
when seeking to facilitate supervisory co -operation for multijurisdictional 
VASPs; and 
o. set out best practice in relation to the types of information countries should 
maintain on licensed/registered VASPs, as part of their respective directories 
or websites.  
355. These Principles are non-binding on supervisors. They are intended as guidance 
for supervisors. Supervisors are not obliged to adopt and implement these 
Principles, nor are Supervisors obliged to share information or render co-operation 
unless it is consis tent with their domestic frameworks (which could condition co -
operation and exchange of information on the adoption of legal arrangements such 
as Memorandums of Understanding) and does not contradict the obligations arising 
from R. 37-40.  
356. These Principles are, however, applicable to all countries, whether they permit or 
prohibit VASPs. Countries that prohibit VASPs must have a legal basis for permitting 
their relevant competent authorities to exchange information on issues related to 
virtual assets and VAS Ps. This competent authority may not be a supervisor, but 
may be, for example, a law enforcement agency. 
Principles of Information-Sharing and Co-operation 
357. International co-operation between Supervisors should be encouraged and based 
upon a foundation of m utual trust. Information -sharing arrangements must 
recognize and allow room for case-by-case solutions to specific problems. 
Identification of Supervisors and VASPs 
1. Countries must clearly identify their Supervisor(s) of VASPs for AML/CFT 
purposes. Where a country has multiple Supervisors, the country should clearly 
identify the scope of each Supervisors’ regulatory remit. 
2. Supervisors should have a clear mechanism by which to receive inquiries relating 
to VASPs. For example, this could be a specific email ad dress for VASP -related 
inquiries.  
3. To facilitate timely co-operation, Supervisors should ensure that information on 
licensed or registered VASPs under their purview is readily accessible by foreign 
authorities. This could be done, for example, through the publication of public 
registers of obliged entities, or the maintenance of a licensed/registered entities 
database that can be queried through secure information exchange. 
Information exchange  
4. Supervisors should exchange relevant information on VASPs with  foreign 
Supervisors, regardless of their status. To this end, Supervisors should have an 
104  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
adequate legal basis for providing co-operation on money laundering, associated 
predicate offences and the financing of terrorism. 
5. There are a number of methods by wh ich supervisory information could be 
exchanged. Most typically, information could be exchanged bilaterally, upon 
request from one Supervisor to another. Where VASPs are multilateral in nature, 
supervisors may also decide to share information multilaterally , with all other 
regulators of the VASP. Lastly, less sensitive supervisory information could be 
shared as necessary, at supervisory colleges organized by lead supervisors of 
multilateral VASPs. Given the cross -border nature of VASPs, the development of 
supervisory colleges for larger multilateral VASPs could serve to enhance overall 
AML/CFT supervision of these entities. 
6. The types of information exchanged between supervisors would depend on a 
range of factors such as the trigger(s) for the exchange of info rmation, statutory 
and/or blockchain data obtained by the Supervisor rendering assistance, and 
countries’ domestic legal frameworks. Where available and legally permitted, 
supervisors should provide where relevant, information such as a VASP’s 
regulatory s tatus, details of its shareholders and directors, transaction -related 
data and user information (which could have been obtained from supervisory 
activities, statutory returns, and blockchain surveillance and analytical tools). 
Supervisors should also consi der exercising its supervisory powers to obtain 
further information from the VASP, where necessary. 
7. A Supervisor requesting information should disclose, to the Supervisor that will 
process the request, the reason for the request, and to the extent possible  the 
purpose for which the information will be used, and provide enough information 
to enable the Supervisor receiving the request to provide information lawfully. 
8. Supervisors should acknowledge receipt of requests, respond to requests for 
information, and  provide interim partial or negative responses in a timely 
manner. 
9. Supervisors should not prohibit or place unreasonable or unduly restrictive 
conditions on exchanging information or providing assistance. In particular, 
Supervisors should not refuse a request for assistance on the grounds that: 
a. laws require FIs, DNFBPs or VASPs (except where the relevant 
information that is sought is held under circumstances where legal 
privilege or legal professional secrecy applies) to maintain secrecy or 
confidentiality; 
b. there is an inquiry, investigation or proceeding underway in the country 
receiving the request, unless the assistance would impede that inquiry, 
investigation or proceeding; and/or 
c. the nature or status of the requesting counterpart authority is different to 
its foreign Supervisor. 
10. Information received, processed, held or disseminated by requesting Supervisors 
must be securely protected, exchanged and used only in accordance with agreed 
procedures, policies and applicable laws and regulations. 
11. Exchanged inf ormation should be used only for the purpose for which the 
information was sought or provided. Any dissemination of the information to 
other authorities or third parties, or any use of this information for 
UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS  105 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
administrative, investigative, prosecutorial or ju dicial purposes, beyond those 
originally approved, should be subject to prior authorization by the requested 
Supervisor. At a minimum, the requesting financial supervisor should promptly 
inform the requested Supervisor of its legal obligation to disclose o r report the 
information to a third party.  
12. Supervisors should be proactive in raising material issues and concerns with 
other Supervisors and should respond in a timely and satisfactory manner when 
such issues and concerns are raised with them. 
13. Supervisors should consider proactively sharing information or requesting 
information as necessary to carry out their supervisory functions. Possible 
triggers for such a request include: 
a.  a cybersecurity incident has taken place in a local VASP that has potential 
AML/CFT impact on other jurisdictions; 
b. where a foreign-based VASP is potentially conducting unregulated VASP 
activity in a jurisdiction; and 
c. where a local VASP is strongly suspected to be facilitating illicit ML/TF 
activity, and has substantial operations based in foreign jurisdictions. 
14. Upon request and whenever possible, Supervisors should provide feedback to 
their foreign counterparts on the use of the information provided, as well as on 
the outcome of the analysis conducted, based on the information provided. 
15. Supervisors should communicate emerging issues and developments of a 
material and potentially adverse nature, including supervisory actions, with other 
relevant Supervisors of the VASP in a timely manner. 
16. Supervisors should share, with other relevant S upervisors of the VASP, 
information affecting the regulated entity for which the latter have responsibility, 
including supervisory actions, except in unusual circumstances when supervisory 
considerations dictate otherwise. 
Co-operation  
17. In some instances, a primary Supervisor could be identified if the VASP has 
significant proportion of its business operations in a jurisdiction. While 
supervisors should work together to identify a primary Supervisor who could act 
as a focal point through which to co -ordinate information sharing and co -
operation, such identification is not mandatory and does not absolve other 
Supervisors of the responsibility to supervise the VASP in their respective 
jurisdictions. 
18. Supervisors should use the most efficient means to co -operate. If bilateral or 
multilateral agreements or arrangements, such as a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU), are needed, these should be negotiated and signed in a 
timely way with the widest possible range of foreign Supervisors in the context of 
international co-operation to counter money laundering, associated predicate 
offences and terrorist financing. 
19. Supervisors should be able to conduct queries on behalf of foreign Supervisors, 
and exchange with these foreign Supervisors all information that they would be 
able to obtain if such queries were carried out domestically. 
106  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
20. When requesting co -operation, Supervisors should make their best efforts to 
provide complete, factual and, as appropriate, legal information including the 
description of the case in concern. This includes indicating any need for urgency, 
to enable timely and efficient execution of the requests for co-operation.

Annex A. Recommendation 15 and its Interpretive Note and FATF Definitions 
Recommendation 15 – New Technologies 
Countries and financial institutions should identify and assess the money laundering or terrorist 
financing risks that may arise in relation to (a) the development of new products and new business 
practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and (b) the use of new or developing technologies for 
both new and pre -existing products. In the case of financial institutions, such a risk assessment 
should take place prior to the launch of the new products, business practices or the use of new or 
developing technologies. They should take appropriate measures to manage and mitigate those 
risks. 
To manage and mitigate the risks emerging from virtual assets, countries should ensure that virtual 
asset service providers are regulated for AML/CFT purposes, and licensed or registered and subject 
to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the relevant measures called for 
in the FATF Recommendations. 
Interpretative Note to Recommendation 15 
1. For the purposes of applying the FATF Recommendations, countries should consider 
virtual assets as “property,” “proceeds,” “funds,” “funds or other assets,” or other 
“corresponding value.” Countries should apply the relevant measures under the FATF 
Recommendations to virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs).  
2. In accordance w ith Recommendation 1, countries should identify, assess, and 
understand the money laundering and terrorist financing risks emerging from virtual 
asset activities and the activities or operations of VASPs. Based on that assessment, 
countries should apply a risk-based approach to ensure that measures to prevent or 
mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing are commensurate with the risks 
identified. Countries should require VASPs to identify, assess, and take effective action 
to mitigate their money laundering and terrorist financing risks.  
3. VASPs should be required to be licensed or registered. At a minimum, VASPs should 
be required to be licensed or registered in the jurisdiction(s) where they are created.1 
In cases where the VASP is a natural person, they should be required to be licensed or 
registered in the jurisdiction where their place of business is located. Jurisdictions 
may also require VASPs that offer products and/or services to customers in, or 
conduct operations from, their jurisdiction to be licensed or registered in this 
jurisdiction. Competent authorities should take the necessary legal or regulatory 
measures to prevent criminals or their associates from holding, or being the beneficial 
owner of, a significant or controlling interest, or holding a management function in, a 
VASP. Countries should take action to identify natural or legal persons that carry out 
VASP activities without the requisite license or registration, and apply appropriate 
sanctions.  
4. A country need not impose a separate licensing or registration system with respect to 
natural or legal persons already licensed or registered as financial institutions (as 
defined by the FATF Recommendations) within that country, which, under such 
license or registration, are permitted to pe rform VASP activities and which are 
already subject to the full range of applicable obligations under the FATF 
Recommendations.  
108  UPDATED GUIDANCE: A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO VIRTUAL ASSETS AND VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
  
© FATF/OECD 2021 
5. Countries should ensure that VASPs are subject to adequate regulation and 
supervision or monitoring for AML/CFT and are effecti vely implementing the 
relevant FATF Recommendations, to mitigate money laund ering and terrorist 
financing risks emerging from virtual assets. VASPs should be subject to effective 
systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with national AML/CFT 
requirements. VASPs should be supervised or monitored by a competent authority 
(not a SRB), which should conduct risk-based supervision or monitoring. Supervisors 
should have adequate powers to supervise or monitor and ensure compliance by 
VASPs with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist financing 
including the authority to conduct inspections, compel the production of information, 
and impose sanctions. Supervisors should have powers to impose a range of 
disciplinary and financial sanctions, includi ng the power to withdraw, restrict or 
suspend the VASP’s license or registration, where applicable.  
6. Countries should ensure that there is a range of effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive sanctions, whether criminal, civil or administrative, available to deal with 
VASPs that fail to comply with AML/CFT requirements, in line with Recommendation 
35. Sanctions should be applicable not only to VASPs, but also to their directors and 
senior management.  
7. With respect to preventive measures, the requirements set out in Recommendations 
10 to 21 apply to VASPs, subject to the following qualifications:  
8. (a) R.10 – The occasional transactions designated threshold above which VASPs are 
required to conduct CDD is USD/EUR 1 000.  
9. (b) R.16 – Countries should ensure that o riginating VASPs obtain and hold required 
and accurate originator information and required beneficiary information2 on virtual 
asset transfers, submit 3 the above information to the beneficiary VASP or financial 
institution (if any) immediately and securely , and make it available on request to 
appropriate authorities. Countries should ensure that beneficiary VASPs obtain and 
hold required originator information and required and accurate beneficiary 
information on virtual asset transfers, and make it available on request to appropriate 
authorities. Other requirements of R.16 (including monitoring of the availability of 
information, and taking freezing action and prohibiting transactions with designated 
persons and entities) apply on the same basis as set out in R.16. The same obligations 
apply to financial institutions when sending or receiving virtual asset transfers on 
behalf of a customer. 
10. Countries should rapidly, constructively, and effectively provide the widest possible 
range of international co -operation in relation to money laundering, predicate 
offences, and terrorist financing relating to virtual assets, on the basis set out in 
Recommendations 37 to 40. In particular, supervisors of VASPs should exchange 
information promptly and constructively with their foreign counterparts, regardless 
of the supervisors’ nature or status and differences in the nomenclature or status of 
VASPs. 
1  References to creating a legal person include incorporation of companies or any other 
mechanism that is used. 
2  As defined in INR. 16, paragraph 6, or the equivalent information in a virtual asset context.  
3  The information can be submitted either directly or indirectly. It is not necessary for this 
information to be attached directly to virtual asset transfers.

Glossary  
A virtual asset  is a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded, or 
transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes. Virtual assets do 
not include digital representations of fiat currencies, securities and other financial 
assets that are already covered elsewhere in the FATF Recommendations.  
Virtual asset service provider means any natural or legal person who is not covered 
elsewhere under the Recommendations, and as a business conducts one or more of
