US President Donald Trump will host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, bringing together industry leaders to discuss regulatory policies, stablecoin oversight, and the potential role of Bitcoin in the US financial system.
The attendees will include “prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry,” along with members of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets, according to an announcement shared by the White House “AI and crypto czar,” David Sacks, in a March 1 X post.
The summit will be chaired by Sacks and administered by Bo Hines, the executive director of the Working Group.

Sacks was appointed White House Crypto and AI and Czar on Dec. 6, 2024, to “work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.,” Trump wrote in the announcement. 
Part of Sacks’ role will be to “safeguard” online speech and “steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship,” Trump added.

Trump has previously signaled that he intends to make crypto policy a national priority and make the US a global hub for blockchain innovation. The upcoming summit may set the tone for crypto regulations over the next four years.
Sacks only has two years to push through pro-crypto policies before the 2026 midterm elections in the US, Joe Doll, the general counsel for NFT marketplace Magic Eden, told Cointelegraph in an interview.
According to Doll, the threat of a gridlocked government could stifle regulations, and the current administration must push through pro-crypto policies while still in control of both chambers of Congress.

While there are no additional details about the summit’s agenda, stablecoin regulation and legislation related to a potential strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve have been at the forefront of regulatory discussions in the US.
The White House announcement came days after Jeremy Allaire, co-founder of Circle, the company behind the world’s second-largest stablecoin, said that stablecoin issuers worldwide should be required to register with US authorities.
Citing consumer protection, Allaire argued that US dollar-based stablecoin issuers should not get a “free pass,” enabling them to “ignore the US law and go do whatever the hell you want wherever and sell into the United States.” Allaire told Bloomberg:
The upcoming summit may shed more light on upcoming stablecoin legislation, considering Sacks previously stated that stablecoins could “extend the dollar's dominance internationally.”

Interest in a US-based strategic Bitcoin reserve is also on the rise. So far, at least 24 states have introduced legislation related to a potential Bitcoin reserve, Bitcoinlaws data shows.

However, the state-level Bitcoin reserve initiatives may not represent a pivotal moment for Bitcoin; they are only a “symbolic move” unless a significant purchase is announced, according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at Nexo.
“Unless the hearing unveils a near-term purchase plan or a major policy shift, the market’s response will likely be mild, as Texas’ pro-crypto stance is already well known,” Kalchev told Cointelegraph.
Bitcoin has averaged over 1,077% returns over the past five years, showing the lucrative potential of a long-term holding strategy.

The Bitcoin bounce to $85,000 on Feb. 28 had traders hopeful that a bottom was in could be in peril after BTC (BTC) struggled to secure a higher high candlestick for the daily close. 
Data from TRDR.io shows Bitcoin received a strong spot bid at Coinbase as the price fell to a 2025 low at $78,300, but what is yet to be seen is whether or not bulls will be able to provide enough purchasing volume to sustain their current momentum.

Crypto trader Magus suggested that the most likely path forward for Bitcoin is range building in the $72,000 to $85,000 range for a number of weeks.

In addition to the absence of strong spot demand, trader Horse added that Bitcoin returns through the weekend could trend down based on traders’ interpretation of President Trump’s comments throughout the weekend. 
While the consensus among traders appears to project choppy price action for Bitcoin over the coming weeks, the 29% drawdown from the $110,000 all-time high is not extraordinary for BTC. As pointed out by crypto trader ‘intern,’ 30% corrections are par for the course during Bitcoin bull markets, and historically, they have proven to be optimal purchase opportunities.

The Bitcoin sell-off, which dominated a majority of the weak, appears to be easing off, with BTC price making a recovery back in the $80,000 range to reach an intra-day high at $85,120. 
Some traders believe that Bitcoin (BTC) was overdue for a bounce, given how deeply oversold some of its technical indicators had become. Those holding that belief warn that once bids are filled near the recent lows, if new buyers fail to sustain the momentum or negative macroeconomic newsflow resumes, BTC is likely to revisit its recent lows. 
HighStrike head of options and crypto trading JJ took a different view, noting that “Coinbase spot bids” were “filled,” representing the “first flip of bids outweighing asks now since the September bottom at $52,000.”

Regardless of the short-term price action from Bitcoin, many analysts continue to say that historical data highlights the recent drawdown as a prime purchasing opportunity.

Momentum and technical traders should note that Bitcoin daily RSI remains in deeply oversold territory, and despite the strength of today’s rebound, the daily candlestick pattern of lower highs and lower lows. Failure to establish a daily close candlestick that generates a higher high could be an early sign that the downtrend is not yet complete.

5d9065ab27697108d5d473ff9551d0fb,Cointelegraph,States likely to adopt Bitcoin reserves first: Report,https://cointelegraph.com/news/states-adopt-bitcoin-reserves-first-senator-lummis," US Senator Cynthia Lummis expects progress toward a Bitcoin reserve to be slower at the federal level. 
States are likely to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) reserves before the US federal government does, Senator Cynthia Lummis reportedly said on Feb. 28 during the Bitcoin Investor Week conference in New York. 
“My bets are that you’ll see a state have a Bitcoin strategic reserve before the federal government,” Lummis said, according to a Bloomberg report. 
In July 2024, Lummis, a Wyoming Republican, proposed legislation that would require the US federal government to create a national Bitcoin stockpile. 
Her bill, dubbed the BITCOIN Act, calls for the US Treasury Department to gradually accumulate 1 million BTC, ultimately acquiring “a total stake of approximately 5% of total Bitcoin supply, mirroring the size and scope of gold reserves held by the United States,” according to Lummis’ website.

In January, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring federal officials to study the feasibility of a national Bitcoin stockpile. It was one of the first actions of Trump’s second presidential term, which started on Jan. 20. 
In February, Trump signed another order instructing the US government to create a sovereign wealth fund, which could potentially serve as a vehicle for buying BTC.
“We’re seeing the United Arab Emirates purchase Bitcoin. You’re going to look at some of the sovereign wealth funds around the world who are not as tied up in a democratic republic like we are, be able to just make it so,” Lummis reportedly said. 
There are currently 18 US states that have crypto reserve bills pending Senate votes, while two — Arizona and Utah —  are in the final stages of the approval process.
State crypto investment bills have been rejected in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota and Pennsylvania. 
Although some states run by Democrats might resist Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, others are expected to embrace crypto as a bipartisan issue. 
“[T]here are so many states out there that are pro-crypto, and they don’t necessarily follow blue or red policies,” Ashley Gunn, Coinbase’s senior manager for US policy, said during a Feb. 28 ETHDenver panel attended by Cointelegraph. 
Establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States would accelerate Bitcoin’s adoption even more than 2024’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches, cryptocurrency researcher CoinShares said in January.
“We believe that the enactment of the Bitcoin Act in the United States would have a more profound long-term impact on Bitcoin than the launch of ETFs,” CoinShares said.
Launched in January 2024, US-based Bitcoin ETFs hold upward of $100 billion worth of BTC.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. 
Today in crypto, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced the launch of Solana futures contracts in March. Meanwhile, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a globally recognized derivatives exchange, announced it will launch Solana (SOL) futures contracts on March 17, pending a review by United States financial regulators.
According to the Feb. 28 announcement, market participants will have access to micro contracts of 25 SOL or standard contract sizes of 500 SOL, and all contracts will be cash-settled. CME Group already provides futures and options contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to investors looking to hedge against the highly volatile nature of these digital assets.
The addition of Solana futures contracts gives traditional finance investors additional exposure to the crypto markets and provides the crypto markets with fresh capital injections that should support prices.

Bitcoin risks more downside if it loses a “key” $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.
Analysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs.

These macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
Still, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin’s correction may see the world’s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.
Based on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.
The agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins “do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws” and “are akin to collectibles.”

“As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said.
It added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn’t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins “may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.”

9dee862da1b6d7fca85ae383034d3283,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin’s ‘Trump trade’ is over — Traders shift hope to Fed rate cuts, expanding global liquidity",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-trump-trade-is-over-will-fed-rate-cuts-and-m2-expansion-help," The pre-and-post-election Trump trade sent Bitcoin to new highs, but the jig is up. Traders now shift their hope to the resumption of QE and expanding global liquidity. 
Financial markets are sending mixed signals as uncertainty reaches new highs. On Feb. 25, the US debt ceiling was raised from $36.1 trillion to $40.1 trillion, marking another massive expansion in government borrowing.
Following a historical pattern, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield reacted to the news by dropping from 4.4% to 4.29%. While this may seem counterintuitive, markets tend to interpret debt ceiling resolutions as stabilizing events, reducing near-term uncertainty even if they imply higher borrowing down the line.
However, the stock and crypto markets, which usually benefit from lower bond yields as capital rotates into risk assets, have continued their fall that started last week. Since Feb. 21, the S&P 500 has lost 3%, the Nasdaq100 has dropped 5%, and Bitcoin has plunged 16%. The leading cryptocurrency is now trading 26% below its all-time high reached on President Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day, effectively erasing the Trump pump. 
A simultaneous decline in stocks and bond yields is not typical market behavior and suggests growing risk aversion and economic slowdown fears. 
Recent US economic data released on Feb. 21 has shown notable signs of weakness. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell to 64.7 in February, down from 71.7 in January. This marks the lowest level since November 2023 and came in below the preliminary estimate of 67.8, which was also the consensus forecast among economists polled by Reuters. 
Existing home sales dropped 4.9%, and the S&P Global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell from 52.7 in January to 50.4, the lowest since Sept. 2023. PMI tracks manufacturing and services activity, and a reading barely above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction indicates stagnating growth in the private sector.
Trade tensions add to market uncertainty. On Feb. 24, Trump said that tariffs on Canada and Mexico “will go forward” after the deadline for the monthlong delay ends next week. Trump’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on the European Union, revealed on Feb. 26, and an additional 10% levy on Chinese goods added to the growing market anxiety 
In commentary to CNBC, Chris Rupkey, Chief Economist at FWDBonds, unapologetically said, 
Rupkey elaborated, “The economy is coming in for a crash landing this year. Bet on it. The bond market is.” 
In the crypto market, the Fear & Greed Index has plunged to 10, or Extreme Fear - a stark contrast to the Greed levels seen at the beginning of February.

In January, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes speculated that a battle over the debt ceiling—combined with a reluctance to spend down the Treasury General Account—could push 10-year Treasury yields above 5%, triggering a stock market crash and forcing the the Federal Reserve to intervene. 
In his view, this could help President Trump to pressure the Fed into adopting a mode dovish stance. In other words, a small crisis to justify the QE and stimulate the economy. 
For Hayes, this mini-crisis must occur early in Trump’s presidency, during  Q1 or Q2, so he could blame it on the leverage built up during the Biden administration. 
Ironically, even though the debt ceiling was raised with minimal drama, and 10-year Treasury yields have actually fallen, the stock market still dropped. The most pressing question now is whether this will lead to interest rate cuts.
The Fed remains neutral, with recent economic data providing little reason for an imminent policy shift. The latest CPI report on Feb. 11 showed inflation accelerating to 0.5% month-over-month, pushing the annual rate to 3%, both exceeding expectations. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that the central bank won’t rush to cut rates further. Despite this position, a combination of weakening economic indicators and liquidity expansion may eventually force the Fed’s hand later this year.

Despite the current market downturn, not all hope is lost, as a massive wave of liquidity expansion could be on the horizon. The expanding M2 global liquidity supply could breathe fresh air into the risk-on markets, especially Bitcoin. However, this might take some time.
The M2 Global Liquidity Index 3-Month Offset provides a useful framework for forecasting liquidity-driven market movements. This indicator shifts M2 money supply data forward by three months to analyze its relationship with risk assets.
Crypto analyst Crypto Rover highlighted this on X, stating:

The historical performance shows that BTC usually lags approximately 60 days behind major global liquidity movements. The current drop inscribes perfectly into this picture, which also promises a strong rebound by June if liquidity trends hold.
Jeff Park, head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, echoed the sentiment:

Tether’s competitors are exerting increasingly more pressure to push the world’s largest stablecoin issuer out of the crypto market, including political pressure aimed at reducing the firm’s leading market share.
In the wider crypto markets, analysts are suggesting that most cryptocurrencies won’t see a widespread “altcoin season” rally in 2025, and only select tokens with sustainable investor interest and revenue-generating models will be able to outperform the rest of the tokens.
Tether’s competitors are working to push the world’s largest stablecoin issuer out of the crypto market, according to the company’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino.
Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDt (USDT), has a market capitalization of more than $142 billion — over twice as large as Circle’s USD Coin’s (USDC) $56 billion, according to Cointelegraph data.
However, the stablecoin issuer faces mounting pressure from competing firms and politicians, Ardoino said in a Feb. 25 X post.
“I’ll leave it to you to define a competitor trying to use lawfare to kill an opponent, instead of focusing on better products,” Ardoino added.
Tether will continue focusing on its mission to promote global financial inclusion, particularly in underdeveloped economies, Ardoino said, noting that USDT is used by more than 400 million people and gains 35 million new wallets each quarter.
Ardoino’s comments followed Tether’s exclusion from the list of 10 firms approved to issue stablecoins under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework.

The hacker behind the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit has laundered more than $335 million in digital assets, with investigators continuing to track the movement of stolen funds.
Crypto investor sentiment was hit by the largest hack in crypto history on Feb. 21, when Bybit lost over $1.4 billion in liquid-staked Ether (STETH), Mantle Staked ETH (mETH) and other digital assets.
Onchain data shows that the hacker has moved 45,900 Ether (ETH) — worth about $113 million — in the past 24 hours, bringing the total amount laundered to more than 135,000 ETH, valued at $335 million.
That left the hacker with about 363,900 ETH, worth around $900 million, according to pseudonymous blockchain analyst EmberCN.

Ethereum-based cryptocurrency wallet MetaMask is expanding its fiat off-ramp services to support 10 additional blockchain networks. The move, in partnership with payments provider Transak, is aimed at simplifying the process of converting digital assets into traditional currency.
MetaMask users were previously forced to swap assets into Ether (ETH) tokens before being able to convert them into fiat money, adding extra steps and transaction fees.
However, as part of MetaMask’s ongoing partnership with Transak, the wallet will add support to 10 new networks: the Arbitrum mainnet, Avalanche C-Chain mainnet, Base, BNB Chain, Celo, Fantom, Moonbeam, Moonriver, Optimism and Polygon.
The first four tokens to receive immediate off-ramping support include ETH on Ethereum, ETH on Optimisim, BNB (BNB) and the Polygon (POL) token. Support for the additional six networks will be gradually rolled out.
“By expanding off-ramping capabilities with Transak, MetaMask is removing barriers between crypto and traditional currency, allowing users to convert a broader range of tokens directly to cash,” said Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys.

5fde9dd30ffcb8cdbd70c28d452ad845,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin rebounds to $84K — Analysts say BTC crash was ultimate buy signal,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rebounds-to-84-k-analysts-say-btc-crash-was-ultimate-buy-signal," Regulatory developments, nation-state exposure, onchain data and TradFi integration are proof that BTC’s fundamentals were unaffected by the recent sell-off. 
Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped 21.3% between Feb. 21 and Feb. 28, retesting the $78,300 level for the first time since November 2024. The correction led to over $1.6 billion in leveraged long (buy) liquidations, adding to market volatility as exchanges forcefully sold contracts. The $21,210 decline marked the largest seven-day drop in Bitcoin’s history.
Despite the pullback, several Bitcoin analysts see this as a strong buying opportunity. They cite factors such as regulatory developments, sovereign fund exposure, onchain and technical signals, and increasing integration with traditional finance, including bank adoption as collateral and structured product offerings.

User Obviously_Obv, reportedly a Web3 game researcher at Sigil Fund, stated that the current price action resembles a “bear trap,” as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hit its lowest levels since 2022. He also claimed that government entities worldwide are “about to buy Bitcoin,” not just the U.S.
Similarly, Eric Weiss, CEO of Blockchain Investment Group LP, shared a report from Tephra Digital outlining key events that could drive higher adoption rates and positively impact Bitcoin’s price.

According to the report, the next steps include in-kind creation and redemption for Bitcoin ETF issuers in the US, improving market efficiency. Another key factor is the legal classification of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, which would allow BTC deposits to be used as collateral, similar to gold. Analysts also highlight increasing exposure from sovereign wealth funds and the approval of solicited sales by banks as potential catalysts for wider Bitcoin adoption.

According to the analyst, traders should “soak up the cheap coins” as the “opportunity won’t last forever.” From an onchain analysis perspective, data suggests that long-term holders were not the main contributors to Bitcoin’s drop below $80,000, increasing the likelihood of a swift recovery above $95,000.
Source: CarlBMenger
User CarlBMenger, author of the Carl ₿ Menger's Newsletter, noted that “74% of the realized Bitcoin losses came from holders who bought in the last month.” He added that inexperienced traders are folding under pressure, while seasoned investors remain unaffected by the price fluctuation.
Beyond the potential buying pressure from nation-states, Luke Broyles, a collaborator at Blockware Mining, explained on X that a single US-listed company could acquire 84,090 BTC. This would make it the second-largest holder after Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which currently holds 499,096 BTC.

Broyles’ hypothesis assumes the company would use its entire cash and equivalent position to buy Bitcoin at $88,000 and raise an additional $3 billion in debt to increase holdings at $110,000. However, even if GameStop allocated only 20% of its current reserves, that would represent 11,765 BTC at $85,000—enough to secure the fourth-largest position behind MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms.

Different analysis models suggest that buying Bitcoin below $85,000 is a golden opportunity, one that may not be available for long. Bitcoin's censorship resistance and digital scarcity features have not been impacted by the worsening macroeconomic environment. In time, its price is expected to rise above $100,000, reflecting the conviction of its current holders and benefiting from deeper integration into the traditional finance system.

Crypto analyst Saint Pump said on X that Spoofy builds his position “extremely slowly” and may buy more if the markets fall further.

The current correction has not deterred Standard Chartered’s long-term view. In a CNBC interview, Standard Chartered head of digital assets research Geoffrey Kendrick said that Bitcoin could recover to $200,000 this year and surge to $500,000 before President Trump finishes his second term. 
Could Bitcoin start a recovery, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
Bitcoin closed below the $85,000 support on Feb. 26, and the bears successfully defended the level on Feb. 27.

Sellers tried to sink the BTC/USDT pair to $73,777, but the bulls purchased the dip to $78,258 on Feb. 28. Buyers will try to push the price back above the $85,000 to $90,000 resistance zone. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that a short-term bottom may be in place.
Conversely, if the price turns down sharply from the overhead resistance zone, it indicates selling on every minor rally. The pair could then descend to the vital support at $73,777, where buyers are expected to step in.
Ether (ETH) rebounded off the $2,111 support, indicating that the bulls are trying to keep the price inside the large range.

The bulls will attempt to stretch the recovery to the 20-day EMA ($2,611) and then to the downtrend line. Sellers are expected to aggressively defend the downtrend line. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the ETH/USDT pair could retest the $2,111 level. If this support cracks, the pair may sink to $2,000 and later to $1,900.
Contrary to this assumption, a break and close above the downtrend line suggests that the bears are losing their grip. The pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($2,932). 
XRP (XRP) turned down from the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on Feb. 26, suggesting that the bears have flipped the level into resistance.

The XRP/USDT pair dipped below the $2.06 support on Feb. 28, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. Buyers will attempt to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they can pull it off, it will signal that the bulls are back in the game.
Contrarily, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. That increases the possibility of a drop to the crucial support at $1.77.
BNB (BNB) rebounded off the support near $557, indicating that the bulls are trying to defend the level.

The BNB/USDT pair will attempt a relief rally, which is expected to face strong selling at the 20-day EMA ($634). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it increases the likelihood of a break below $557. If that happens, the pair could collapse to $500. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $460 and $500.
On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could then reach the 50-day SMA ($656).
Solana (SOL) slipped below the $133 support on Feb. 28, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.

There is minor resistance at $147, but it is likely to be crossed. If the price holds above $147, the SOL/USDT pair could reach the 20-day EMA ($169). Sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge at the 20-day EMA, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could extend its recovery to the 50-day SMA ($201).
This optimistic view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below $125. The pair could then plummet to $110.
Buyers failed to push Dogecoin (DOGE) back above the support line, suggesting that the bears have flipped the level into resistance.

The selling resumed on Feb. 28, and the bears will try to sink the price to $0.15. However, the RSI has slipped into the oversold zone, suggesting that a relief rally could be around the corner. Buyers will have to push and maintain the DOGE/USDT pair above the 20-day EMA ($0.24) to start a sustained recovery.
The failure to push the price back above the 20-day EMA increases the risk of a drop to $0.13 and then to $0.10.
Cardano (ADA) is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the support line of the descending channel pattern.

If the price sustains below the support line, the selling could pick up, and the ADA/USDT pair may drop to $0.50. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.50 level with all their might because a close below it could sink the pair to $0.33.
If the price turns up from the support line, the pair could reach the 20-day EMA (0.73). This is a vital overhead resistance to watch out for because a break above it suggests that the pair may remain inside the channel for some more time.

Litecoin (LTC) has been oscillating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.

The 20-day EMA ($122) is flattish, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to push the LTC/USDT pair above the resistance line. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $147.
Conversely, a break below the 50-day SMA ($117) opens the gates for a drop to the support line. If this level gives way, the pair could plunge to $80.
The failure of the bulls to start a strong recovery from the support line triggered another round of selling by the bears in Chainlink (LINK).

If the price sustains below the support line, the selling could accelerate, and the LINK/USDT pair could drop to $12.71 and, subsequently, to $10.
If buyers want to prevent the downside, they will have to swiftly push the price back above $16. The pair could then rise to the 20-day EMA ($17.42), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. Buyers will have to push the price above the 20-day EMA to suggest that the break below the support line may have been a bear trap.
Avalanche (AVAX) tried to rise above the breakdown level of $22.35 on Feb. 27, but the bears held their ground.

The bears resumed selling on Feb. 28. If the price breaks and maintains below $20, the AVAX/USDT pair could retest the solid support at $17.29. This is an important level to watch out for because a break below it may sink the pair to $15.
Time is running out for the bulls. They will have to push and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA ($24.55) to start a recovery. The pair may rise to $27.50, which is again expected to act as a resistance.

add1f78252b245911a920ab8f616acf0,Cointelegraph,Bitcoin crash triggered by erosion of ETF cash and carry trade — Analyst,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-crash-triggered-erosion-etf-cash-carry-trade-analyst," The arrival of institutional investors has been both a blessing and a curse for long-term Bitcoin holders. 
Since reaching all-time highs on Jan. 20, Bitcoin’s price has been suppressed by hedge funds exploiting a low-risk yield trade involving spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and CME futures, signaling once again that institutional adoption of crypto assets isn’t a one-way street.
This is the general takeaway of analyst Kyle Chassé, who dissected the latest Bitcoin (BTC) price crash in a thread on the X social media platform. 
“For months, hedge funds were exploiting a low-risk yield trade using BTC spot ETFs & CME futures,” said Chassé. Now, this cash and carry trade is “imploding,” he said.

The cash and carry trade involved buying spot Bitcoin ETFs and shorting Bitcoin futures on CME, which allowed traders to earn up to 5.68% in annualized returns by Chassé’s calculation. 
The success of this trade depended mainly on Bitcoin futures trading at a premium to the cryptocurrency’s spot price. However, “with recent market weakness, that premium has collapsed,” said Chassé.
With the trade no longer profitable, hedge funds are exiting the market, which is evidenced by the record outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs this week.
“The same trade that kept Bitcoin stable on the way up is accelerating the crash now,” he said. This is happening because “hedge funds don’t care about Bitcoin. They weren’t betting on BTC mooning. They were farming low-risk yield.”

Bitcoin’s sell-off accelerated on Feb. 27, as the cryptocurrency retraced all the way back to the sub-$79,000 region for the first time in more than three months.
However, a closer look at onchain data reveals that the losses are mainly concentrated among Bitcoin tourists, or new traders who only entered the market recently. 
Data from Glassnode shows that 74% of the realized losses came from holders who bought in the last month.

Nevertheless, unrealized losses from the recent sell-off exceeded crypto exchange FTX’s capitulation event, according to analyst Milkybull Crypto. A drop of this magnitude is a strong sign of a bottom formation in Bitcoin’s price.
